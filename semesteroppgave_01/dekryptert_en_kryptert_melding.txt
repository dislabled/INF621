year one thousand sevenhundred and seventyfive conduct their greatnesses and myriads ofsmall creatures the creatures of this chronicle among the rest alongthe roads that lay before them  ii  the mail  it was the dover road that lay on a friday night late innovember before the first of the persons with whom this history hasbusiness the dover road lay as to him beyond the dover mail asit lumbered up shooters hill he walked up hill in the mire by theside of the mail as the rest of the passengers did not becausethey had the least relish for walking exercise under thecircumstances but because the hill and the harness and the mud andthe mail were all so heavy that the horses had three times alreadycome to a stop besides once drawing the coach across the road withthe mutinous intent of taking it back to blackheath reins and whipand coachman and guard however in combination had read that articleof war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of theargument that some brute animals are endued with reason and the teamhad capitulated and returned to their duty  with drooping heads and tremulous tails they mashed their waythrough the thick mud floundering and stumbling between whiles as ifthey were falling to pieces at the larger joints as often as thedriver rested them and brought them to a stand with a wary wohosohothen the near leader violently shook his head and everythingupon it like an unusually emphatic horse denying that the coachcould be got up the hill whenever the leader made this rattle thepassenger started as a nervous passenger might and was disturbedin mind  there was a steaming mist in all the hollows and it had roamed inits forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit seeking rest andfinding none a clammy and intensely cold mist it made its slow waythrough the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread oneanother as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do it was denseenough to shut out everything from the light of the coachlamps butthese its own workings and a few yards of road and the reek of thelabouring horses steamed into it as if they had made it all  two other passengers besides the one were plodding up the hillby the side of the mail all three were wrapped to the cheekbonesand over the cars and wore jackboots not one of the three couldhave said from anything he saw what either of the other two waslike and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from theeyes of the mind as from the eyes of the body of his two companionsin those days travellers were very shy of being confidential on ashort notice for anybody on the road might be a robber or in leaguewith robbers as to the latter when every postinghouse and alehousecould produce somebody in the captains pay ranging from thelandlord to the lowest stable nondescript it was the likeliestthing upon the cards so the guard of the dover mail thought tohimself that friday night in november one thousand seven hundred andseventyfive lumbering up shooters hill as he stood on his ownparticular perch behind the mail beating his feet and keeping an eyeand a hand on the armchest before him where a loaded blunderbuss layat the top of six or eight loaded horsepistols deposited on asubstratum of cutlass  the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guardsuspected the passengers the passengers suspected one another and theguard they all suspected everybody else and the coachman was sure ofnothing but the horses as to which cattle he could with a clearconscience have taken his oath on the two testaments that they werenot fit for the journey  woho said the coachman so then one more pull and youre atthe top and be damned to you for i have had trouble enough to get youto it joe  halloa the guard replied  what oclock do you make it joe  ten minutes good past eleven  my blood ejaculated the vexed coachman and not atop ofshooters yet tst yah get on with you  the emphatic horse cut short by the whip in a most decidednegative made a decided scramble for it and the three other horsesfollowed suit once more the dover mail struggled on with thejackboots of its passengers squashing along by its side they hadstopped when the coach stopped and they kept close company with itif any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another towalk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness he would have puthimself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman  the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill thehorses stopped to breathe again and the guard got down to skid thewheel for the descent and open the coachdoor to let the passengersin  tst joe cried the coachman in a warning voice looking down fromhis box  what do you say tom  they both listened  i say a horse at a canter coming up joe  i say a horse at a gallop tom returned the guard leaving hishold of the door and mounting nimbly to his place gentlemen in thekings name all of you  with this hurried adjuration he cocked his blunderbuss and stoodon the offensive  the passenger booked by this history was on the coachstep gettingin the two other passengers were close behind him and about tofollow he remained on the step half in the coach and half out ofthey remained in the road below him they all looked from the coachmanto the guard and from the guard to the coachman and listened thecoachman looked back and the guard looked back and even theemphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back withoutcontradicting  the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling andlabouring of the coach added to the stillness of the night made itvery quiet indeed the panting of the horses communicated atremulous motion to the coach as if it were in a state ofagitation the hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to beheard but at any rate the quiet pause was audibly expressive ofpeople out of breath and holding the breath and having the pulsesquickened by expectation  the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up thehill  soho the guard sang out as loud as he could roar yo therestand i shall fire  the pace was suddenly checked and with much splashing andfloundering a mans voice called from the mist is that the dovermail  never you mind what it is the guard retorted what are you  is that the dover mail  why do you want to know  i want a passenger if it is  what passenger  mr jarvis lorry  our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name theguard the coachman and the two other passengers eyed himdistrustfully  keep where you are the guard called to the voice in the mistbecause if i should make a mistake it could never be set right inyour lifetime gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight  what is the matter asked the passenger then with mildlyquavering speech who wants me is it jerry  i dont like jerrys voice if it is jerry growled the guardto himself hes hoarser than suits me is jerry  yes mr lorry  what is the matter  a despatch sent after you from over yonder t and co  i know this messenger guard said mr lorry getting down intothe road assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the othertwo passengers who immediately scrambled into the coach shut thedoor and pulled up the window he may come close theres nothingwrong  i hope there aint but i cant make so nation sure of that saidthe guard in gruff soliloquy hallo you  well and hallo you said jerry more hoarsely than before  come on at a footpace dye mind me and if youve got holstersto that saddle o yourn dont let me see your hand go nigh em forim a devil at a quick mistake and when i make one it takes theform of lead so now lets look at you  the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddyingmist and came to the side of the mail where the passenger stood therider stooped and casting up his eyes at the guard handed thepassenger a small folded paper the riders horse was blown andboth horse and rider were covered with mud from the hoofs of thehorse to the hat of the man  guard said the passenger in a tone of quiet business confidence  the watchful guard with his right hand at the stock of his raisedblunderbuss his left at the barrel and his eye on the horsemananswered curtly sir  there is nothing to apprehend i belong to tellsons bank you mustknow tellsons bank in london i am going to paris on business acrown to drink i may read this  if so be as youre quick sir  he opened it in the light of the coachlamp on that side andread first to himself and then aloud wait at dover for mamselleits not long you see guard jerry say that my answer was recalledto life  jerry started in his saddle thats a blazing strange answer toosaid he at his hoarsest  take that message back and they will know that i received this aswell as if i wrote make the best of your way good night  with those words the passenger opened the coachdoor and got in notat all assisted by his fellowpassengers who had expeditiouslysecreted their watches and purses in their boots and were nowmaking a general pretence of being asleep with no more definitepurpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind ofaction  the coach lumbered on again with heavier wreaths of mist closinground it as it began the descent the guard soon replaced hisblunderbuss in his armchest and having looked to the rest of itscontents and having looked to the supplementary pistols that hewore in his belt looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat in whichthere were a few smiths tools a couple of torches and a tinderboxfor he was furnished with that completeness that if the coachlampshad been blown and stormed out which did occasionally happen hehad only to shut himself up inside keep the flint and steel sparkswell off the straw and get a light with tolerable safety and ease ifhe were lucky in five minutes  tom softly over the coach roof  hallo joe  did you hear the message  i did joe  what did you make of it tom  nothing at all joe  thats a coincidence too the guard mused for i made the sameof it myself  jerry left alone in the mist and darkness dismounted meanwhilenot only to ease his spent horse but to wipe the mud from his faceand shake the wet out of his hatbrim which might be capable ofholding about half a gallon after standing with the bridle over hisheavilysplashed arm until the wheels of the mail were no longerwithin hearing and the night was quite still again he turned towalk down the hill  after that there gallop from temple bar old lady i wont trustyour forelegs till i get you on the level said this hoarsemessenger glancing at his mare recalled to life thats a blazingstrange message much of that wouldnt do for you jerry i sayjerry youd be in a blazing bad way if recalling to life was to comeinto fashion jerry  iii  the night shadows  a wonderful fact to reflect upon that every human creature isconstituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other asolemn consideration when i enter a great city by night that everyone of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret thatevery room in every one of them encloses its own secret that everybeating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there is insome of its imaginings a secret to the heart nearest it something ofthe awfulness even of death itself is referable to this no more cani turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved and vainly hope intime to read it all no more can i look into the depths of thisunfathomable water wherein as momentary lights glanced into it ihave had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged itwas appointed that the book should shut with a spring for ever andfor ever when i had read but a page it was appointed that thewater should be locked in an eternal frost when the light was playingon its surface and i stood in ignorance on the shore my friend isdead my neighbour is dead my love the darling of my soul isdead it is the inexorable

sleeper more inscrutable thanits busy inhabitants are in their innermost personality to me orthan i am to them  as to this his natural and not to be alienated inheritance themessenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the kingthe first minister of state or the richest merchant in london sowith the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of onelumbering old mail coach they were mysteries to one another ascomplete as if each had been in his own coach and six or his owncoach and sixty with the breadth of a county between him and thenext  the messenger rode back at an easy trot stopping pretty often atalehouses by the way to drink but evincing a tendency to keep his owncounsel and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes he had eyes thatassorted very well with that decoration being of a surface blackwith no depth in the colour or form and much too near together as ifthey were afraid of being found out in something singly if they kepttoo far apart they had a sinister expression under an old cockedhatlike a threecornered spittoon and over a great muffler for thechin and throat which descended nearly to the wearers knees when hestopped for drink he moved this muffler with his left hand onlywhile he poured his liquor in with his right as soon as that wasdone he muffled again  no jerry no said the messenger harping on one theme as herode it wouldnt do for you jerry jerry you honest tradesmanit wouldnt suit your line of business recalled bust me if idont think hed been a drinking  his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fainseveral times to take off his hat to scratch his head except onthe crown which was raggedly bald he had stiff black hair standingjaggedly all over it and growing down hill almost to his broad bluntnose it was so like smiths work so much more like the top of astrongly spiked wall than a head of hair that the best of playersat leapfrog might have declined him as the most dangerous man in theworld to go over  while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to thenight watchman in his box at the door of tellsons bank by templebar who was to deliver it to greater authorities within theshadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of themessage and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of herprivate topics of uneasiness they seemed to be numerous for sheshied at every shadow on the road  what time the mailcoach lumbered jolted rattled and bumped uponits tedious way with its three fellowinscrutables inside to whomlikewise the shadows of the night revealed themselves in the formstheir dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested  tellsons bank had a run upon it in the mail as the bank passengerwith an arm drawn through the leathern strap which did what lay in itto keep him from pounding against the next passenger and drivinghim into his corner whenever the coach got a special jolt nodded inhis place with halfshut eyes the little coachwindows and thecoachlamp dimly gleaming through them and the bulky bundle ofopposite passenger became the bank and did a great stroke ofbusiness the rattle of the harness was the chink of money and moredrafts were honoured in five minutes than even tellsons with allits foreign and home connection ever paid in thrice the time thenthe strongrooms underground at tellsons with such of theirvaluable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger and it wasnot a little that he knew about them opened before him and hewent in among them with the great keys and the feeblyburningcandle and found them safe and strong and sound and still just ashe had last seen them  but though the bank was almost always with him and though thecoach in a confused way like the presence of pain under an opiatewas always with him there was another current of impression thatnever ceased to run all through the night he was on his way to digsome one out of a grave  now which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves beforehim was the true face of the buried person the shadows of the nightdid not indicate but they were all the faces of a man offiveandforty by years and they differed principally in the passionsthey expressed and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted statepride contempt defiance stubbornness submission lamentationsucceeded one another so did varieties of sunken cheek cadaverouscolour emaciated hands and figures but the face was in the mainone face and every head was prematurely white a hundred times thedozing passenger inquired of this spectre  buried how long  the answer was always the same almost eighteen years  you had abandoned all hope of being dug out  long ago  you know that you are recalled to life  they tell me so  i hope you care to live  i cant say  shall i show her to you will you come and see her  the answers to this question were various and contradictorysometimes the broken reply was wait it would kill me if i saw hertoo soon sometimes it was given in a tender rain of tears and thenit was take me to her sometimes it was staring and bewildered andthen it was i dont know her i dont understand  after such imaginary discourse the passenger in his fancy woulddig and dig dig now with a spade now with a great key now withhis hands to dig this wretched creature out got out at last withearth hanging about his face and hair he would suddenly fall awayto dust the passenger would then start to himself and lower thewindow to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek  yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain on themoving patch of light from the lamps and the hedge at the roadsideretreating by jerks the night shadows outside the coach would fallinto the train of the night shadows within the real bankinghouseby temple bar the real business of the past day the real strongrooms the real express sent after him and the real message returnedwould all be there out of the midst of them the ghostly face wouldrise and he would accost it again  buried how long  almost eighteen years  i hope you care to live  i cant say  dig dig dig until an impatient movement from one of the twopassengers would admonish him to pull up the window draw his armsecurely through the leathern strap and speculate upon the twoslumbering forms until his mind lost its hold of them and they againslid away into the bank and the grave  buried how long  almost eighteen years  you had abandoned all hope of being dug out  long ago  the words were still in his hearing as just spoken distinctly inhis hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life when theweary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight and foundthat the shadows of the night were gone  he lowered the window and looked out at the rising sun there was aridge of ploughed land with a plough upon it where it had been leftlast night when the horses were unyoked beyond a quiet coppicewoodin which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remainedupon the trees though the earth was cold and wet the sky wasclear and the sun rose bright placid and beautiful  eighteen years said the passenger looking at the sungracious creator of day to be buried alive for eighteen years  iv  the preparation  when the mail got successfully to dover in the course of theforenoon the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened thecoachdoor as his custom was he did it with some flourish ofceremony for a mail journey from london in winter was anachievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon  by that time there was only one adventurous traveller left to becongratulated for the two others had been set down at theirrespective roadside destinations the mildewy inside of the coachwith its damp and dirty straw its disagreeable smell and itsobscurity was rather like a larger dogkennel mr lorry thepassenger shaking himself out of it in chains of straw a tangle ofshaggy wrapper flapping hat and muddy legs was rather like a largersort of dog  there will be a packet to calais tomorrow drawer  yes sir if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fairthe tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoonsir bed sir  i shall not go to bed till night but i want a bedroom and abarber  and then breakfast sir yes sir that way sir if you pleaseshow concord gentlemans valise and hot water to concord pull offgentlemans boots in concord you will find a fine seacoal firesir fetch barber to concord stir about there now for concord  the concord bedchamber being always assigned to a passenger bythe mail and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped upfrom head to foot the room had the odd interest for the establishmentof the royal george that although but one kind of man was seen togo into it all kinds and varieties of men came out of itconsequently another drawer and two porters and several maids andthe landlady were an loitering by accident at various points of theroad between the concord and the coffeeroom when a gentleman ofsixty formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes pretty wellworn but very well kept with large square cuffs and large flaps tothe pockets passed along on his way to his breakfast  the coffeeroom had no other occupant that forenoon than thegentleman in brown his breakfasttable was drawn before the fire andas he sat with its light shining on him waiting for the meal he satso still that he might have been sitting for his portrait  very orderly and methodical he looked with a hand on each knee anda loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat asthough it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity andevanescence of the brisk fire he had a good leg and was a littlevain of it for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close and wereof a fine texture his shoes and buckles too though plain weretrim he wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig setting very closeto his head which wig it is to be presumed was made of hair butwhich looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk orglass his linen though not of a fineness in accordance with hisstockings was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon theneighbouring beach or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlightfar at sea a face habitually suppressed and quieted was stilllighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that itmust have cost their owner in years gone by some pains to drill tothe composed and reserved expression of tellsons bank he had ahealthy colour in his cheeks and his face though lined bore fewtraces of anxiety but perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks intellsons bank were principally occupied with the cares of otherpeople and perhaps secondhand cares like secondhand clothescome easily off and on  completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for hisportrait mr lorry dropped off to sleep the arrival of his breakfastroused him and he said to the drawer as he moved his chair to it  i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here atany time today she may ask for mr jarvis lorry or she may only askfor a gentleman from tellsons bank please to let me know  yes sir tellsons bank in london sir  yes  yes sir we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemenin their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and parissir a vast deal of travelling sir in tellson and companys house  yes we are quite a french house as well as an english one  yes sir not much in the habit of such travelling yourself ithink sir  not of late years it is fifteen years since wesince i camelast from france  indeed sir that was before my time here sir before our peoplestime here sir the george was in other hands at that time sir  i believe so  but i would hold a pretty wager sir that a house like tellson andcompany was flourishing a matter of fifty not to speak of fifteenyears ago  you might treble that and say a hundred and fifty yet not befar from the truth  indeed sir  rounding his mouth and both his eyes as he stepped backward fromthe table the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to hisleft dropped into a comfortable attitude and stood surveying theguest while he ate and drank as from an observatory or watchtoweraccording to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages  when mr lorry had finished his breakfast he went out for astroll on the beach the little narrow crooked town of dover hiditself away from the beach and ran its head into the chalk cliffslike a marine ostrich the beach was a desert of heaps of sea andstones tumbling wildly about and the sea did what it liked andwhat it liked was destruction it thundered at the town and thunderedat the cliffs and brought the coast down madly the air among thehouses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might havesupposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it as sick people wentdown to be dipped in the sea a little fishing was done in the portand a quantity of strolling about by night and looking seawardparticularly at those times when the tide made and was near floodsmall tradesmen who did no business whatever sometimes unaccountablyrealised large fortunes and it was remarkable that nobody in theneighbourhood could endure a lamplighter  as the day declined into the afternoon and the air which hadbeen at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seenbecame again charged with mist and vapour mr lorrys thoughts seemedto cloud too when it was dark and he sat before the coffeeroomfire awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast his mindwas busily digging digging digging in the live red coals  a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the redcoals no harm otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out ofwork mr lorry had been idle a long time and had just poured out hislast glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfactionas is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexionwho has got to the end of a bottle when a rattling of wheels cameup the narrow street and rumbled into the innyard  he set down his glass untouched this is mamselle said he  in a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that missmanette had arrived from london and would be happy to see thegentleman from tellsons  so soon  miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road and requirednone then and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman fromtellsons immediately if it suited his pleasure and convenience  the gentleman from tellsons had nothing left for it but to emptyhis glass with an air of stolid desperation settle his odd littleflaxen wig at the ears and follow the waiter to miss manettesapartment it was a large dark room furnished in a funereal mannerwith black horsehair and loaded with heavy dark tables these hadbeen oiled and oiled until the two tall candles on the table in themiddle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf as if theywere buried in deep graves of black mahogany and no light to speakof could be expected from them until they were dug out  the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr lorrypicking his way over the wellworn turkey carpet supposed missmanette to be for the moment in some adjacent room until havinggot past the two tall candles he saw standing to receive him by thetable between them and the fire a young lady of not more thanseventeen in a ridingcloak and still holding her strawtravellinghat by its ribbon in her band as his eyes rested on ashort slight pretty figure a quantity of golden hair a pair ofblue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look and a forehead witha singular capacity remembering how young and smooth it was oflifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quiteone of perplexity or wonder or alarm or merely of a bright fixedattention though it included all the four expressions as his eyesrested on these things a sudden vivid likeness passed before himof a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across thatvery channel one cold time when the hail drifted heavily and the searan high the likeness passed away like a breath along the surface ofthe gaunt pierglass behind her on the frame of which a hospitalprocession of negro cupids several headless and all cripples wereoffering black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of thefeminine gender and he made his formal bow to miss manette  pray take a seat sir in a very clear and pleasant young voice alittle foreign in its accent but a very little indeed  i kiss your hand miss said mr lorry with the manners of anearlier date as he made his formal bow again and took his seat  i received a letter from the bank sir yesterday informing methat some intelligence or discovery  the word is not material miss either word will do   respecting the small property of my poor father whom i neversaw so long dead  mr lorry moved in his chair and cast a troubled look towards thehospital procession of negro cupids as if they had any help foranybody in their absurd baskets  rendered it necessary that i should go to paris there tocommunicate with a gentleman of the bank so good as to bedespatched to paris for the purpose  myself  as i was prepared to hear sir  she curtseyed to him young ladies made curtseys in those dayswith a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older andwiser he was than she he made her another bow  i replied to the bank sir that as it was considered necessary bythose who know and who are so kind as to advise me that i shouldgo to france and that as i am an orphan and have no friend whocould go with me i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted toplace myself during the journey under that worthy gentlemansprotection the gentleman had left london but i think a messenger wassent after him to be the favour of his waiting for me here  i was happy said mr lorry to be entrusted with the charge ishall be more happy to execute it  sir i thank you indeed i thank you very gratefully it was toldme by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details ofthe business and that i must prepare myself to find them of asurprising nature i have done my best to prepare myself and inaturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are  naturally said mr lorry yes i  after a pause he added again settling the crisp flaxen wig atthe ears  it is very difficult to begin  he did not begin but in his indecision met her glance theyoung forehead lifted itself into that singular expression but it waspretty and characteristic besides being singular and she raisedher hand as if with an involuntary action she caught at or stayedsome passing shadow  are you quite a stranger to me sir  am i not mr lorry opened his hands and extended them outwardswith an argumentative smile  between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose theline of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be theexpression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in thechair by which she had hitherto remained standing he watched her asshe mused and the moment she raised her eyes again went on  in your adopted country i presume i cannot do better than addressyou as a young english lady miss manette  if you please sir  miss manette i am a man of business i have a business charge toacquit myself of in your reception of it dont heed me any more thanif i was a speaking machine truly i am not much else i will withyour leave relate to you miss the story of one of our customers  story  he seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated when headded in a hurry yes customers in the banking business we usuallycall our connection our customers he was a french gentleman ascientific gentleman a man of great acquirements a doctor  not of beauvais  why yes of beauvais like monsieur manette your father thegentleman was of beauvais like monsieur manette your father thegentleman was of repute in paris i had the honour of knowing himthere our relations were business relations but confidential iwas at that time in our french house and had been oh twenty years  at that time i may ask at what time sir  i speak miss of twenty years ago he married an english ladyand i was one of the trustees his affairs like the affairs of manyother french gentlemen and french families were entirely in tellsonshands in a similar way i am or i have been trustee of one kind orother for scores of our customers these are mere businessrelations miss there is no friendship in them no particularinterest nothing like sentiment i have passed from one to anotherin the course of my business life just as i pass from one of ourcustomers to another in the course of my business day in short ihave no feelings i am a mere machine to go on  but this is my fathers story sir and i begin to think thecuriously roughened forehead was very intent upon him that when iwas left an orphan through my mothers surviving my father only twoyears it was you who brought me to england i am almost sure it wasyou  mr lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidinglyadvanced to take his and he put it with some ceremony to his lips hethen conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again andholding the chairback with his left hand and using his right byturns to rub his chin pull his wig at the ears or point what hesaid stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up intohis  miss manette it was i and you will see how truly i spoke ofmyself just now in saying i had no feelings and that all therelations i hold with my fellowcreatures are mere business relationswhen you reflect that i have never seen you since no you have beenthe ward of tellsons house since and i have been busy with the otherbusiness of tellsons house since feelings i have no time forthem no chance of them i pass my whole life miss in turning animmense pecuniary mangle  after this odd description of his daily routine of employment mrlorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands whichwas most unnecessary for nothing could be flatter than its shiningsurface was before and resumed his former attitude  so far miss as you have remarked this is the story of yourregretted father now comes the difference if your father had notdied when he did dont be frightened how you start  she did indeed start and she caught his wrist with both herhands  pray said mr lorry in a soothing tone bringing his left handfrom the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingersthat clasped him in so violent a tremble pray control youragitation a matter of business as i was saying  her look so discomposed him that he stopped wandered and begananew  as i was saying if monsieur manette had not died if he hadsuddenly and silently disappeared if he had been spirited away if ithad not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place though noart could trace him if he had an enemy in some compatriot who couldexercise a privilege that i in my own time have known the boldestpeople afraid to speak of in a whisper across the water there forinstance the privilege of filling up blank forms for theconsignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length oftime if his wife had implored the king the queen the queen thecourt the clergy for any tidings of him and all quite in vainthen the history of your father would have been the history of thisunfortunate gentleman the doctor of beauvais  i entreat you to tell me more sir  i will i am going to you can bear it  i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at thismoment  you speak collectedly and you are collected thats goodthough his manner was less satisfied than his words a matter ofbusiness regard it as a matter of business business that must bedone now if this doctors wife though a lady of great courage andspirit had suffered so intensely from this cause before her littlechild was born  the little child was a daughter sir  a daughter a a matter of business dont be distressed miss ifthe poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child wasborn that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child theinheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of byrearing her in the belief that her father was dead no dontkneel in heavens name why should you kneel to me  for the truth o dear good compassionate sir for the truth  a a matter of business you confuse me and how can i transactbusiness if i am confused let us be clearheaded if you could kindlymention now for instance what nine times ninepence are or howmany shillings in twenty guineas it would be so encouraging i shouldbe so much more at my ease about your state of mind  without directly answering to this appeal she sat so still whenhe had very gently raised her and the hands that had not ceased toclasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been that shecommunicated some reassurance to mr jarvis lorry  thats right thats right courage business you have businessbefore you useful business miss manette your mother took thiscourse with you and when she died i believe brokenhearted havingnever slackened her unavailing search for your father she left youat two years old to grow to be blooming beautiful and happywithout the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whetheryour father soon wore his heart out in prison or wasted there throughmany lingering years  as he said the words he looked down with an admiring pity on theflowing golden hair as if he pictured to himself that it might havebeen already tinged with grey  you know that your parents had no great possession and that whatthey had was secured to your mother and to you there has been nonew discovery of money or of any other property but  he felt his wrist held closer and he stopped the expression in theforehead which had so particularly attracted his notice and whichwas now immovable had deepened into one of pain and horror  but he has been been found he is alive greatly changed it istoo probable almost a wreck it is possible though we will hopethe best still alive your father has been taken to the house ofan old servant in paris and we are going there i to identify him ifi can you to restore him to life love duty rest comfort  a shiver ran through her frame and from it through his she saidin a low distinct awestricken voice as if she were saying it ina dream  i am going to see his ghost it will be his ghost not him  mr lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm there therethere see now see now the best and the worst are known to you nowyou are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman and with afair sea voyage and a fair land journey you will be soon at his dearside  she repeated in the same tone sunk to a whisper i have been freei have been happy yet his ghost has never haunted me  only one thing more said mr lorry laying stress upon it as awholesome means of enforcing her attention he has been found underanother name his own long forgotten or long concealed it would beworse than useless now to inquire which worse than useless to seek toknow whether he has been for years overlooked or always designedlyheld prisoner it would be worse than useless now to make anyinquiries because it would be dangerous better not to mention thesubject anywhere or in any way and to remove him for a while at allevents out of france even i safe as an englishman and eventellsons important as they are to french credit avoid all naming ofthe matter i carry about me not a scrap of writing openlyreferring to it this is a secret service altogether mycredentials entries and memoranda are all comprehended in the oneline recalled to life which may mean anything but what is thematter she doesnt notice a word miss manette  perfectly still and silent and not even fallen back in her chairshe sat under his hand utterly insensible with her eyes open andfixed upon him and with that last expression looking as if it werecarved or branded into her forehead so close was her hold upon hisarm that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt hertherefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving  a wildlooking woman whom even in his agitation mr lorry observedto be all of a red colour and to have red hair and to be dressedin some extraordinary tightfitting fashion and to have on her head amost wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure and goodmeasure too or a great stilton cheese came running into the roomin advance of the inn servants and soon settled the question of hisdetachment from the poor young lady by laying a brawny hand uponhis chest and sending him flying back against the nearest wall  i really think this must be a man was mr lorrys breathlessreflection simultaneously with his coming against the wall  why look at you all bawled this figure addressing the innservants why dont you go and fetch things instead of standingthere staring at me i am not so much to look at am i why dontyou go and fetch things ill let you know if you dont bringsmellingsalts cold water and quick i will  there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives and shesoftly laid the patient on a sofa and tended her with great skill andgentleness calling her my precious and my bird and spreadingher golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care  and you in brown she said indignantly turning to mr lorrycouldnt you tell her what you had to tell her without frighteningher to death look at her with her pretty pale face and her coldhands do you call that being a banker  mr lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard toanswer that he could only look on at a distance with much feeblersympathy and humility while the strong woman having banished the innservants under the mysterious penalty of letting them know somethingnot mentioned if they stayed there staring recovered her charge by aregular series of gradations and coaxed her to lay her droopinghead upon her shoulder  i hope she will do well now said mr lorry  no thanks to you in brown if she does my darling pretty  i hope said mr lorry after another pause of feeble sympathy andhumility that you accompany miss manette to france  a likely thing too replied the strong woman if it was everintended that i should go across salt water do you suppose providencewould have cast my lot in an island  this being another question hard to answer mr jarvis lorrywithdrew to consider it  v  the wineshop  a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken in the street theaccident had happened in getting it out of a cart the cask hadtumbled out with a run the hoops had burst and it lay on thestones just outside the door of the wineshop shattered like awalnutshell  all the people within reach had suspended their business or theiridleness to run to the spot and drink the wine the roughirregular stones of the street pointing every way and designedone might have thought expressly to lame all living creatures thatapproached them had dammed it into little pools these weresurrounded each by its own jostling group or crowd according toits size some men kneeled down made scoops of their two handsjoined and sipped or tried to help women who bent over theirshoulders to sip before the wine had all run out between theirfingers others men and women dipped in the puddles with little mugsof mutilated earthenware or even with handkerchiefs from womensheads which were squeezed dry into infants mouths others made smallmudembankments to stern the wine as it ran others directed bylookerson up at high windows darted here and there to cut offlittle streams of wine that started away in new directions othersdevoted themselves to the sodden and leedyed pieces of the casklicking and even champing the moister winerotted fragments witheager relish there was no drainage to carry off the wine and notonly did it all get taken up but so much mud got taken up alongwith it that there might have been a scavenger in the street ifanybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculouspresence  a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices voices of menwomen and children resounded in the street while this wine gamelasted there was little roughness in the sport and much playfulnessthere was a special companionship in it an observable inclinationon the part of every one to join some other one which led especiallyamong the luckier or lighterhearted to frolicsome embraces drinkingof healths shaking of hands and even joining of hands and dancing adozen together when the wine was gone and the places where it hadbeen most abundant were raked into a gridironpattern by fingersthese demonstrations ceased as suddenly as they had broken out theman who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cuttingset it in motion again the women who had left on a doorstep thelittle pot of hot ashes at which she had been trying to soften thepain in her own starved fingers and toes or in those of her childreturned to it men with bare arms matted locks and cadaverousfaces who had emerged into the winter light from cellars moved awayto descend again and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared morenatural to it than sunshine  the wine was red wine and had stained the ground of the narrowstreet in the suburb of saint antoine in paris where it was spilledit had stained many hands too and many faces and many naked feetand many wooden shoes the hands of the man who sawed the wood leftred marks on the billets and the forehead of the woman who nursed herbaby was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about herhead again those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask hadacquired a tigerish smear about the mouth and one tall joker sobesmirched his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap thanin it scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wineleesblood  the time was to come when that wine too would be spilled on thestreetstones and when the stain of it would be red upon many there  and now that the cloud settled on saint antoine which a momentarygleam had driven from his sacred countenance the darkness of it washeavy cold dirt sickness ignorance and want were the lords inwaiting on the saintly presence nobles of great power all of thembut most especially the last samples of a people that hadundergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill andcertainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people youngshivered at every corner passed in and out at every doorway lookedfrom every window fluttered in every vestige of a garment that thewind shook the mill which had worked them down was the mill thatgrinds young people old the children had ancient faces and gravevoices and upon them and upon the grown faces and ploughed intoevery furrow of age and coming up afresh was the sigh hunger it wasprevalent everywhere hunger was pushed out of the tall houses in thewretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines hunger was patchedinto them with straw and rag and wood and paper hunger was repeatedin every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the mansawed off hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys and startedup from the filthy street that had no offal among its refuse ofanything to eat hunger was the inscription on the bakers shelveswritten in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread at thesausageshop in every deaddog preparation that was offered for salehunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in theturned cylinder hunger was shred into atomies in every farthingporringer of husky chips of potato fried with some reluctant drops ofoil  its abiding place was in all things fitted to it a narrow windingstreet full of offence and stench with other narrow windingstreets diverging all peopled by rags and nightcaps and all smellingof rags and nightcaps and all visible things with a brooding lookupon them that looked ill in the hunted air of the people there wasyet some wildbeast thought of the possibility of turning at baydepressed and slinking though they were eyes of fire were not wantingamong them nor compressed lips white with what they suppressednor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallowsrope they musedabout enduring or inflicting the trade sips and they were almost asmany as the shops were all grim illustrations of want thebutcher and the porkman painted up only the leanest scrags of meatthe baker the coarsest of meagre loaves the people rudely picturedas drinking in the wineshops croaked over their scanty measures ofthin wine and beer and were gloweringly confidential togethernothing was represented in a flourishing condition save tools andweapons but the cutlers knives and axes were sharp and brightthe smiths hammers were heavy and the gunmakers stock wasmurderous the crippling stones of the pavement with their manylittle reservoirs of mud and water had no footways but broke offabruptly at the doors the kennel to make amends ran down the middleof the street when it ran at all which was only after heavy rainsand then it ran by many eccentric fits into the houses across thestreets at wide intervals one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope andpulley at night when the lamplighter had let these down andlighted and hoisted them again a feeble grove of dim wicks swungin a sickly manner overhead as if they were at sea indeed theywere at sea and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest  for the time was to come when the gaunt scarecrows of thatregion should have watched the lamplighter in their idleness andhunger so long as to conceive the idea of improving on his methodand hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys to flare upon thedarkness of their condition but the time was not come yet and everywind that blew over france shook the rags of the scarecrows in vainfor the birds fine of song and feather took no warning  the wineshop was a corner shop better than most others in itsappearance and degree and the master of the wineshop had stoodoutside it in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches looking on atthe struggle for the lost wine its not my affair said he witha final shrug of the shoulders the people from the market did itlet them bring another  there his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up hisjoke he called to him across the way  say then my gaspard what do you do there  the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance as isoften the way with his tribe it missed its mark and completelyfailed as is often the way with his tribe too  what now are you a subject for the mad hospital said thewineshop keeper crossing the road and obliterating the jest with ahandful of mud picked up for the purpose and smeared over it whydo you write in the public streets is there tell me thou is thereno other place to write such words in  in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhapsaccidentally perhaps not upon the jokers heart the joker rapped itwith his own took a nimble spring upward and came down in afantastic dancing attitude with one of his stained shoes jerked offhis foot into his hand and held out a joker of an extremely notto say wolfishly practical character he looked under thosecircumstances  put it on put it on said the other call wine wine and finishthere with that advice he wiped his soiled hand upon the jokersdress such as it was quite deliberately as having dirtied thehand on his account and then recrossed the road and entered thewineshop  this wineshop keeper was a bullnecked martiallooking man ofthirty and he should have been of a hot temperament for although itwas a bitter day he wore no coat but carried one slung over hisshoulder his shirtsleeves were rolled up too and his brown armswere bare to the elbows neither did he wear anything more on his headthan his own crisplycurling short dark hair he was a dark manaltogether with good eyes and a good bold breadth between themgoodhumoured looking on the whole but implacablelooking tooevidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose a man notdesirable to be met rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf oneither side for nothing would turn the man  madame defarge his wife sat in the shop behind the counter as hecame in madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age with awatchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything a large handheavily ringed a steady face strong features and great composure ofmanner there was a character about madame defarge from which onemight have predicated that she did not often make mistakes againstherself in any of the reckonings over which she presided madamedefarge being sensitive to cold was wrapped in fur and had aquantity of bright shawl twined about her head though not to theconcealment of her large earrings her knitting was before her butshe had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick thus engagedwith her right elbow supported by her left hand madame defarge saidnothing when her lord came in but coughed just one grain of coughthis in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrowsover her toothpick by the breadth of a line suggested to herhusband that he would do well to look round the shop among thecustomers for any new customer who had dropped in while he steppedover the way  the wineshop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about until theyrested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady who were seatedin a corner other company were there two playing cards two playingdominoes three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supplyof wine as he passed behind the counter he took notice that theelderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady this is our man  what the devil do you do in that galley there said monsieurdefarge to himself i dont know you  but he feigned not to notice the two strangers and fell intodiscourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at thecounter  how goes it jacques said one of these three to monsieur defargeis all the spilt wine swallowed  every drop jacques answered monsieur defarge  when this interchange of christian name was effected madamedefarge picking her teeth with her toothpick coughed another grainof cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line  it is not often said the second of the three addressing monsieurdefarge that many of these miserable beasts know the taste ofwine or of anything but black bread and death is it not sojacques  it is so jacques monsieur defarge returned  at this second interchange of the christian name madame defargestill using her toothpick with profound composure coughed anothergrain of cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of anotherline  the last of the three now said his say as he put down his emptydrinking vessel and smacked his lips  ah so much the worse a bitter taste it is that such poor cattlealways have in their mouths and hard lives they live jacques am iright jacques  you are right jacques was the response of monsieur defarge  this third interchange of the christian name was completed at themoment when madame defarge put her toothpick by kept her eyebrows upand slightly rustled in her seat  hold then true muttered her husband gentlemen my wife  the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge withthree flourishes she acknowledged their homage by bending her headand giving them a quick look then she glanced in a casual mannerround the wineshop took up her knitting with great apparent calmnessand repose of spirit and became absorbed in it  gentlemen said her husband who had kept his bright eyeobservantly upon her good day the chamber furnishedbachelorfashion that you wished to see and were inquiring forwhen i stepped out is on the fifth floor the doorway of thestaircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left herepointing with his hand near to the window of my establishmentbut now that i remember one of you has already been there and canshow the way gentlemen adieu  they paid for their wine and left the place the eyes of monsieurdefarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderlygentleman advanced from his corner and begged the favour of a word  willingly sir said monsieur defarge and quietly stepped withhim to the door  their conference was very short but very decided almost at thefirst word monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive ithad not lasted a minute when he nodded and went out the gentlemanthen beckoned to the young lady and they too went out madamedefarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows and sawnothing  mr jarvis lorry and miss manette emerging from the wineshop thusjoined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed hisown company just before it opened from a stinking little blackcourtyard and was the general public entrance to a great pile ofhouses inhabited by a great number of people in the gloomytilepaved entry to the gloomy tilepaved staircase monsieurdefarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master andput her hand to his lips it was a gentle action but not at allgently done a very remarkable transformation had come over him in afew seconds he had no goodhumour in his face nor any openness ofaspect left but had become a secret angry dangerous man  it is very high it is a little difficult better to begin slowlythus monsieur defarge in a stern voice to mr lorry as theybegan ascending the stairs  is he alone the latter whispered  alone god help him who should be with him said the other inthe same low voice  is he always alone then  yes  of his own desire  of his own necessity as he was when i first saw him after theyfound me and demanded to know if i would take him and at my peril bediscreet as he was then so he is now  he is greatly changed  changed  the keeper of the wineshop stopped to strike the wall with hishand and mutter a tremendous curse no direct answer could havebeen half so forcible mr lorrys spirits grew heavier and heavieras he and his two companions ascended higher and higher  such a staircase with its accessories in the older and morecrowded parts of paris would be bad enough now but at that time itwas vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses every littlehabitation within the great foul nest of one high building that is tosay the room or rooms within every door that opened on the generalstaircase left its own heap of refuse on its own landing besidesflinging other refuse from its own windows the uncontrollable andhopeless mass of decomposition so engendered would have pollutedthe air even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it withtheir intangible impurities the two bad sources combined made italmost insupportable through such an atmosphere by a steep darkshaft of dirt and poison the way lay yielding to his own disturbanceof mind and to his young companions agitation which becamegreater every instant mr jarvis lorry twice stopped to rest each ofthese stoppages was made at a doleful grating by which anylanguishing good airs that were left uncorrupted seemed to escapeand all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in through therusted bars tastes rather than glimpses were caught of thejumbled neighbourhood and nothing within range nearer or lowerthan the summits of the two great towers of notredame had anypromise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations  at last the top of the staircase was gained and they stopped forthe third time there was yet an upper staircase of a steeperinclination and of contracted dimensions to be ascended before thegarret story was reached the keeper of the wineshop always goinga little in advance and always going on the side which mr lorrytook as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young ladyturned himself about here and carefully feeling in the pockets ofthe coat he carried over his shoulder took out a key  the door is locked then my friend said mr lorry surprised  ay yes was the grim reply of monsieur defarge  you think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman soretired  i think it necessary to turn the key monsieur defarge whisperedit closer in his ear and frowned heavily  why  why because he has lived so long locked up that he would befrightened rave tear himself to pieces die come to i know not whatharm if his door was left open  is it possible exclaimed mr lorry  is it possible repeated defarge bitterly yes and abeautiful world we live in when it is possible and when many othersuch things are possible and not only possible but done done seeyou under that sky there every day long live the devil let usgo on  this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper that not aword of it had reached the young ladys ears but by this time shetrembled under such strong emotion and her face expressed such deepanxiety and above all such dread and terror that mr lorry felt itincumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance  courage dear miss courage business the worst will be over ina moment it is but passing the roomdoor and the worst is overthen all the good you bring to him all the relief all the happinessyou bring to him begin let our good friend here assist you onthat side thats well friend defarge come now businessbusiness  they went up slowly and softly the staircase was short and theywere soon at the top there as it had an abrupt turn in it they cameall at once in sight of three men whose heads were bent down closetogether at the side of a door and who were intently looking into theroom to which the door belonged through some chinks or holes in thewall on hearing footsteps close at hand these three turned androse and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had beendrinking in the wineshop  i forgot them in the surprise of your visit explained monsieurdefarge leave us good boys we have business here  the three glided by and went silently down  there appearing to be no other door on that floor and the keeper ofthe wineshop going straight to this one when they were left alonemr lorry asked him in a whisper with a little anger  do you make a show of monsieur manette  i show him in the way you have seen to a chosen few  is that well  i think it is well  who are the few how do you choose them  i choose them as real men of my name jacques is my name towhom the sight is likely to do good enough you are english thatis another thing stay there if you please a little moment  with an admonitory gesture to keep them back he stooped and lookedin through the crevice in the wall soon raising his head again hestruck twice or thrice upon the door evidently with no other objectthan to make a noise there with the same intention he drew the keyacross it three or four times before he put it clumsily into thelock and turned it as heavily as he could  the door slowly opened inward under his hand and he looked into theroom and said something a faint voice answered something little morethan a single syllable could have been spoken on either side  he looked back over his shoulder and beckoned them to enter mrlorry got his arm securely round the daughters waist and held herfor he felt that she was sinking  a a a business business he urged with a moisture that wasnot of business shining on his cheek come in come in  i am afraid of it she answered shuddering  of it what  i mean of him of my father  rendered in a manner desperate by her state and by the beckoning oftheir conductor he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon hisshoulder lifted her a little and hurried her into the room he sather down just within the door and held her clinging to him  defarge drew out the key closed the door locked it on theinside took out the key again and held it in his hand all this hedid methodically and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment ofnoise as he could make finally he walked across the room with ameasured tread to where the window was he stopped there and facedround  the garret built to be a depository for firewood and the likewas dim and dark for the window of dormer shape was in truth a doorin the roof with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of storesfrom the street unglazed and closing up the middle in two pieceslike any other door of french construction to exclude the cold onehalf of this door was fast closed and the other was opened but a verylittle way such a scanty portion of light was admitted throughthese means that it was difficult on first coming in to seeanything and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any onethe ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity yetwork of that kind was being done in the garret for with his backtowards the door and his face towards the window where the keeperof the wineshop stood looking at him a whitehaired man sat on a lowbench stooping forward and very busy making shoes  vi  the shoemaker  good day said monsieur defarge looking down at the white beadthat bent low over the shoemaking  it was raised for a moment and a very faint voice responded tothe salutation as if it were at a distance  good day  you are still hard at work i see  after a long silence the head was lifted for another moment andthe voice replied yes i am working this time a pair of haggardeyes had looked at the questioner before the face had dropped again  the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful it was not thefaintness of physical weakness though confinement and hard fare nodoubt had their part in it its deplorable peculiarity was that itwas the faintness of solitude and disuse it was like the lastfeeble echo of a sound made long and long ago so entirely had it lostthe life and resonance of the human voice that it affected the senseslike a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain sosunken and suppressed it was that it was like a voice underground soexpressive it was of a hopeless and lost creature that a famishedtraveller wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness would haveremembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die  some minutes of silent work had passed and the haggard eyes hadlooked up again not with any interest or curiosity but with a dullmechanical perception beforehand that the spot where the onlyvisitor they were aware of had stood was not yet empty  i want said defarge who had not removed his gaze from theshoemaker to let in a little more light here you can bear alittle more  the shoemaker stopped his work looked with a vacant air oflistening at the floor on one side of him then similarly at thefloor on the other side of him then upward at the speaker  what did you say  you can bear a little more light  i must bear it if you let it in laying the palest shadow of astress upon the second word  the opened halfdoor was opened a little further and secured atthat angle for the time a broad ray of light fell into the garretand showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap pausingin his labour his few common tools and various scraps of leather wereat his feet and on his bench he had a white beard raggedly cutbut not very long a hollow face and exceedingly bright eyes thehollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to looklarge under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair thoughthey had been really otherwise but they were naturally large andlooked unnaturally so his yellow rags of shirt lay open at thethroat and showed his body to be withered and worn he and his oldcanvas frock and his loose stockings and all his poor tatters ofclothes had in a long seclusion from direct light and air fadeddown to such a dull uniformity of parchmentyellow that it would havebeen hard to say which was which  he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light and the verybones of it seemed transparent so he sat with a steadfastly vacantgaze pausing in his work he never looked at the figure before himwithout first looking down on this side of himself then on that asif he had lost the habit of associating place with sound he neverspoke without first wandering in this manner and forgetting tospeak  are you going to finish that pair of shoes today askeddefarge motioning to mr lorry to come forward  what did you say  do you mean to finish that pair of shoes today  i cant say that i mean to i suppose so i dont know  but the question reminded him of his work and he bent over itagain  mr lorry came silently forward leaving the daughter by the doorwhen he had stood for a minute or two by the side of defarge theshoemaker looked up he showed no surprise at seeing another figurebut the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as helooked at it his lips and his nails were of the same paleleadcolour and then the hand dropped to his work and he oncemore bent over the shoe the look and the action had occupied but aninstant  you have a visitor you see said monsieur defarge  what did you say  here is a visitor  the shoemaker looked up as before but without removing a handfrom his work  come said defarge here is monsieur who knows a wellmadeshoe when he sees one show him that shoe you are working at take itmonsieur  mr lorry took it in his hand  tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is and the makers name  there was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker replied  i forget what it was you asked me what did you say  i said couldnt you describe the kind of shoe for monsieursinformation  it is a ladys shoe it is a young ladys walkingshoe it is inthe present mode i never saw the mode i have had a pattern in myhand he glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride  and the makers name said defarge  now that he had no work to hold he laid the knuckles of the righthand in the hollow of the left and then the knuckles of the left handin the hollow of the right and then passed a hand across hisbearded chin and so on in regular changes without a momentsintermission the task of recalling him from the vagrancy into whichhe always sank when he had spoken was like recalling some very weakperson from a swoon or endeavouring in the hope of somedisclosure to stay the spirit of a fastdying man  did you ask me for my name  assuredly i did  one hundred and five north tower  is that all  one hundred and five north tower  with a weary sound that was not a sigh nor a groan he bent to workagain until the silence was again broken  you are not a shoemaker by trade said mr lorry lookingsteadfastly at him  his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferredthe question to him but as no help came from that quarter theyturned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground  i am not a shoemaker by trade no i was not a shoemaker bytrade i i learnt it here i taught myself i asked leave to  he lapsed away even for minutes ringing those measured changeson his hands the whole time his eyes came slowly back at last tothe face from which they had wandered when they rested on it hestarted and resumed in the manner of a sleeper that moment awakereverting to a subject of last night  i asked leave to teach myself and i got it with much difficultyafter a long while and i have made shoes ever since  as he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from himmr lorry said still looking steadfastly in his face  monsieur manette do you remember nothing of me  the shoe dropped to the ground and he sat looking fixedly at thequestioner  monsieur manette mr lorry laid his hand upon defarges armdo you remember nothing of this man look at him look at me isthere no old banker no old business no old servant no old timerising in your mind monsieur manette  as the captive of many years sat looking fixedly by turns at mrlorry and at defarge some long obliterated marks of an activelyintent intelligence in the middle of the forehead gradually forcedthemselves through the black mist that had fallen on him they wereoverclouded again they were fainter they were gone but they hadbeen there and so exactly was the expression repeated on the fairyoung face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where shecould see him and where she now stood looking at him with handswhich at first had been only raised in frightened compassion if noteven to keep him off and shut out the sight of him but which were nowextending towards him trembling with eagerness to lay the spectralface upon her warm young breast and love it back to life and hope soexactly was the expression repeated though in stronger characters onher fair young face that it looked as though it had passed like amoving light from him to her  darkness had fallen on him in its place he looked at the twoless and less attentively and his eyes in gloomy abstraction soughtthe ground and looked about him in the old way finally with a deeplong sigh he took the shoe up and resumed his work  have you recognised him monsieur asked defarge in a whisper  yes for a moment at first i thought it quite hopeless but i haveunquestionably seen for a single moment the face that i once knew sowell hush let us draw further back hush  she had moved from the wall of the garret very near to the bench onwhich he sat there was something awful in his unconsciousness ofthe figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as hestooped over his labour  not a word was spoken not a sound was made she stood like aspirit beside him and he bent over his work  it happened at length that he had occasion to change theinstrument in his hand for his shoemakers knife it lay on that sideof him which was not the side on which she stood he had taken itup and was stooping to work again when his eyes caught the skirtof her dress he raised them and saw her face the two spectatorsstarted forward but she stayed them with a motion of her hand shehad no fear of his striking at her with the knife though they had  he stared at her with a fearful look and after a while his lipsbegan to form some words though no sound proceeded from them bydegrees in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing he washeard to say  what is this  with the tears streaming down her face she put her two hands to herlips and kissed them to him then clasped them on her breast as ifshe laid his ruined head there  you are not the gaolers daughter  she sighed no  who are you  not yet trusting the tones of her voice she sat down on the benchbeside him he recoiled but she laid her hand upon his arm a strangethrill struck him when she did so and visibly passed over hisframe he laid the knife down softly as he sat staring at her  her golden hair which she wore in long curls had been hurriedlypushed aside and fell down over her neck advancing his hand bylittle and little he took it up and looked at it in the midst of theaction he went astray and with another deep sigh fell to work athis shoemaking  but not for long releasing his ann she laid her hand upon hisshoulder after looking doubtfully at it two or three times as if tobe sure that it was really there he laid down his work put hishand to his neck and took off a blackened string with a scrap offolded rag attached to it he opened this carefully on his knee andit contained a very little quantity of hair not more than one ortwo long golden hairs which he had in some old day wound off uponhis finger  he took her hair into his hand again and looked closely at itit is the same how can it be when was it how was it  as the concentrated expression returned to his forehead he seemedto become conscious that it was in hers too he turned her full to thelight and looked at her  she had laid her head upon my shoulder that night when i wassummoned out she had a fear of my going though i had none andwhen i was brought to the north tower they found these upon my sleeveyou will leave me them they can never help me to escape in the bodythough they may in the spirit those were the words i said iremember them very well  he formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utterit but when he did find spoken words for it they came to himcoherently though slowly  how was this was it you  once more the two spectators started as he turned upon her witha frightful suddenness but she sat perfectly still in his graspand only said in a low voice i entreat you good gentlemen donot come near us do not speak do not move  hark he exclaimed whose voice was that  his hands released her as he uttered this cry and went up to hiswhite hair which they tore in a frenzy it died out as everythingbut his shoemaking did die out of him and he refolded his littlepacket and tried to secure it in his breast but he still looked ather and gloomily shook his head  no no no you are too young too blooming it cant be seewhat the prisoner is these are not the hands she knew this is notthe face she knew this is not a voice she ever heard no no shewas and he was before the slow years of the north tower ages agowhat is your name my gentle angel  hailing his softened tone and manner his daughter fell upon herknees before him with her appealing hands upon his breast  o sir at another time you shall know my name and who my motherwas and who my father and how i never knew their hard hard historybut i cannot tell you at this time and i cannot tell you here allthat i may tell you here and now is that i pray to you to touchme and to bless me kiss me kiss me o my dear my dear  his cold white head mingled with her radiant hair which warmedand lighted it as though it were the light of freedom shining on him  if you hear in my voice i dont know that it is so but i hopeit is if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that oncewas sweet music in your ears weep for it weep for it if youtouch in touching my hair anything that recalls a beloved headthat lay on your breast when you were young and free weep for itweep for it if when i hint to you of a home that is before us wherei will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithfulservice i bring back the remembrance of a home long desolate whileyour poor heart pined away weep for it weep for it  she held him closer round the neck and rocked him on her breastlike a child  if when i tell you dearest dear that your agony is over andthat i have come here to take you from it and that we go to englandto he at peace and at rest i cause you to think of your useful lifelaid waste and of our native france so wicked to you weep for itweep for it and if when i shall tell you of my name and of myfather who is living and of my mother who is dead you learn that ihave to kneel to my honoured father and implore his pardon for havingnever for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept allnight because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from meweep for it weep for it weep for her then and for me goodgentlemen thank god i feel his sacred tears upon my face and hissobs strike against my heart o see thank god for us thank god  he had sunk in her arms and his face dropped on her breast a sightso touching yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and sufferingwhich had gone before it that the two beholders covered their faces  when the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed and hisheaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm thatmust follow all storms emblem to humanity of the rest and silenceinto which the storm called life must hush at last they cameforward to raise the father and daughter from the ground he hadgradually dropped to the floor and lay there in a lethargy worn outshe had nestled down with him that his head might lie upon her armand her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light  if without disturbing him she said raising her hand to mrlorry as he stooped over them after repeated blowings of his noseall could be arranged for our leaving paris at once so that fromthe very door he could be taken away  but consider is he fit for the journey asked mr lorry  more fit for that i think than to remain in this city sodreadful to him  it is true said defarge who was kneeling to look on and hearmore than that monsieur manette is for all reasons best out offrance say shall i hire a carriage and posthorses  thats business said mr lorry resuming on the shortest noticehis methodical manners and if business is to be done i had betterdo it  then be so kind urged miss manette as to leave us here you seehow composed he has become and you cannot be afraid to leave him withme now why should you be if you will lock the door to secure us frominterruption i do not doubt that you will find him when you comeback as quiet as you leave him in any case i will take care ofhim until you return and then we will remove him straight  both mr lorry and defarge were rather disinclined to this courseand in favour of one of them remaining but as there were not onlycarriage and horses to be seen to but travelling papers and astime pressed for the day was drawing to an end it came at last totheir hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done andhurrying away to do it  then as the darkness closed in the daughter laid her head downon the hard ground close at the fathers side and watched him thedarkness deepened and deepened and they both lay quiet until a lightgleamed through the chinks in the wall  mr lorry and monsieur defarge had made all ready for the journeyand had brought with them besides travelling cloaks and wrappersbread and meat wine and hot coffee monsieur defarge put thisprovender and the lamp he carried on the shoemakers bench therewas nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed and he and mr lorryroused the captive and assisted him to his feet  no human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mindin the scared blank wonder of his face whether he knew what hadhappened whether he recollected what they had said to him whether heknew that he was free were questions which no sagacity could havesolved they tried speaking to him but he was so confused and sovery slow to answer that they took fright at his bewilderment andagreed for the time to tamper with him no more he had a wild lostmanner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands that had notbeen seen in him before yet he had some pleasure in the mere soundof his daughters voice and invariably turned to it when she spoke  in the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercionhe ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink and put on thecloak and other wrappings that they gave him to wear he readilyresponded to his daughters drawing her arm through his and took andkept her hand in both his own  they began to descend monsieur defarge going first with the lampmr lorry closing the little procession they had not traversed manysteps of the long main staircase when he stopped and stared at theroof and round at the walls  you remember the place my father you remember coming up here  what did you say  but before she could repeat the question he murmured an answeras if she had repeated it  remember no i dont remember it was so very long ago  that he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought fromhis prison to that house was apparent to them they heard him mutterone hundred and five north tower and when he looked about himit evidently was for the strong fortresswalls which had longencompassed him on their reaching the courtyard he instinctivelyaltered his tread as being in expectation of a drawbridge and whenthere was no drawbridge and he saw the carriage waiting in the openstreet he dropped his daughters hand and clasped his head again  no crowd was about the door no people were discernible at any ofthe many windows not even a chance passerby was in the street anunnatural silence and desertion reigned there only one soul was to beseen and that was madame defarge who leaned against the doorpostknitting and saw nothing  the prisoner had got into a coach and his daughter had followedhim when mr lorrys feet were arrested on the step by his askingmiserably for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes madamedefarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them andwent knitting out of the lamplight through the courtyard shequickly brought them down and handed them in and immediatelyafterwards leaned against the doorpost knitting and saw nothing  defarge got upon the box and gave the word to the barrier thepostilion cracked his whip and they clattered away under the feebleoverswinging lamps  under the overswinging lamps swinging ever brighter in thebetter streets and ever dimmer in the worse and by lighted shopsgay crowds illuminated coffeehouses and theatredoors to one ofthe city gates soldiers with lanterns at the guardhouse thereyour papers travellers see here then monsieur the officer saiddefarge getting down and taking him gravely apart these are thepapers of monsieur inside with the white head they were consigned tome with him at the he dropped his voice there was a flutteramong the military lanterns and one of them being handed into thecoach by an arm in uniform the eyes connected with the arm lookednot an every day or an every night look at monsieur with the whitehead it is well forward from the uniform adieu fromdefarge and so under a short grove of feebler and feebleroverswinging lamps out under the great grove of stars  beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights some so remotefrom this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whethertheir rays have even yet discovered it as a point in space whereanything is suffered or done the shadows of the night were broadand black all through the cold and restless interval until dawnthey once more whispered in the ears of mr jarvis lorry sittingopposite the buried man who had been dug out and wondering whatsubtle powers were for ever lost to him and what were capable ofrestoration the old inquiry  i hope you care to be recalled to life  and the old answer  i cant say                  the end of the first book                                book the second                               the golden thread  i  five years later  tellsons bank by temple bar was an oldfashioned place even in theyear one thousand seven hundred and eighty it was very small verydark very ugly very incommodious it was an oldfashioned placemoreover in the moral attribute that the partners in the house wereproud of its smallness proud of its darkness proud of itsugliness proud of its incommodiousness they were even boastful ofits eminence in those particulars and were fired by an expressconviction that if it were less objectionable it would be lessrespectable this was no passive belief but an active weapon whichthey flashed at more convenient places of business tellsons theysaid wanted no elbowroom tellsons wanted no light tellsonswanted no embellishment noakes and cos might or snooks brothersmight but tellsons thank heaven  any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on thequestion of rebuilding tellsons in this respect the house was muchon a par with the country which did very often disinherit its sonsfor suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long beenhighly objectionable but were only the more respectable  thus it had come to pass that tellsons was the triumphantperfection of inconvenience after bursting open a door of idioticobstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat you fell into tellsonsdown two steps and came to your senses in a miserable little shopwith two little counters where the oldest of men made your chequeshake as if the wind rustled it while they examined the signatureby the dingiest of windows which were always under a showerbath ofmud from fleetstreet and which were made the dingier by their owniron bars proper and the heavy shadow of temple bar if your businessnecessitated your seeing the house you were put into a species ofcondemned hold at the back where you meditated on a misspent lifeuntil the house came with its hands in its pockets and you couldhardly bunk at it in the dismal twilight your money came out of orwent into wormy old wooden drawers particles of which flew up yournose and down your throat when they were opened and shut yourbanknotes had a musty odour as if they were fast decomposing intorags again your plate was stowed away among the neighbouringcesspools and evil communications corrupted its good polish in aday or two your deeds got into extemporised strongrooms made ofkitchens and sculleries and fretted all the fat out of theirparchments into the bankinghouse air your lighter boxes of familypapers went upstairs into a barmecide room that always had a greatdiningtable in it and never had a dinner and where even in the yearone thousand seven hundred and eighty the first letters written toyou by your old love or by your little children were but newlyreleased from the horror of being ogled through the windows by theheads exposed on temple bar with an insensate brutality and ferocityworthy of abyssinia or ashantee  but indeed at that time putting to death was a recipe much invogue with all trades and professions and not least of all withtellsons death is natures remedy for all things and why notlegislations accordingly the forger was put to death the uttererof a bad note was put to death the unlawful opener of a letter wasput to death the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put todeath the holder of a horse at tellsons door who made off withit was put to death the coiner of a bad shilling was put to deaththe sounders of threefourths of the notes in the whole gamut ofcrime were put to death not that it did the least good in the way ofprevention it might almost have been worth remarking that the factwas exactly the reverse but it cleared off as to this world thetrouble of each particular case and left nothing else connectedwith it to be looked after thus tellsons in its day likegreater places of business its contemporaries had taken so manylives that if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on templebar instead of being privately disposed of they would probably haveexcluded what little light the ground floor had in a rathersignificant manner  cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at tellsons theoldest of men carried on the business gravely when they took ayoung man into tellsons london house they hid him somewhere tillhe was old they kept him in a dark place like a cheese until he hadthe full tellson flavour and bluemould upon him then only was hepermitted to be seen spectacularly poring over large books andcasting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of theestablishment  outside tellsons never by any means in it unless called in wasan oddjobman an occasional porter and messenger who served asthe live sign of the house he was never absent during business hoursunless upon an errand and then he was represented by his son agrisly urchin of twelve who was his express image peopleunderstood that tellsons in a stately way tolerated theoddjobman the house had always tolerated some person in thatcapacity and time and tide had drifted this person to the post hissurname was cruncher and on the youthful occasion of his renouncingby proxy the works of darkness in the easterly parish church ofhounsditch he had received the added appellation of jerry  the scene was mr crunchers private lodging in hangingswordalleywhitefriars the time halfpast seven of the clock on a windy marchmorning anno domini seventeen hundred and eighty mr cruncherhimself always spoke of the year of our lord as anna dominoesapparently under the impression that the christian era dated fromthe invention of a popular game by a lady who had bestowed her nameupon it  mr crunchers apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood andwere but two in number even if a closet with a single pane of glassin it might be counted as one but they were very decently kept earlyas it was on the windy march morning the room in which he lay abedwas already scrubbed throughout and between the cups and saucersarranged for breakfast and the lumbering deal table a very cleanwhite cloth was spread  mr cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane like a harlequinat home at first he slept heavily but by degrees began to rolland surge in bed until he rose above the surface with his spiky hairlooking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons at which juncturehe exclaimed in a voice of dire exasperation  bust me if she aint at it agin  a woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees ina corner with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she wasthe person referred to  what said mr cruncher looking out of bed for a boot youre atit agin are you  after hailing the morn with this second salutation he threw aboot at the woman as a third it was a very muddy boot and mayintroduce the odd circumstance connected with mr crunchersdomestic economy that whereas he often came home after banking hourswith clean boots he often got up next morning to find the sameboots covered with clay  what said mr cruncher varying his apostrophe after missinghis mark what are you up to aggerawayter  i was only saying my prayers  saying your prayers youre a nice woman what do you mean byflopping yourself down and praying agin me  i was not praying against you i was praying for you  you werent and if you were i wont be took the liberty withhere your mothers a nice woman young jerry going a praying

of the mouth of her only child  master cruncher who was in his shirt took this very ill andturning to his mother strongly deprecated any praying away of hispersonal board  and what do you suppose you conceited female said mrcruncher with unconscious inconsistency that the worth of yourprayers may be name the price that you put your prayers at  they only come from the heart jerry they are worth no more thanthat  worth no more than that repeated mr cruncher they aintworth much then whether or no i wont be prayed agin i tell you icant afford it im not a going to be made unlucky by yoursneaking if you must go flopping yourself down flop in favour ofyour husband and child and not in opposition to em if i had had anybut a unnatral wife and this poor boy had had any but a unnatralmother i might have made some money last week instead of beingcounterprayed and countermined and religiously circumvented intothe worst of luck buuust me said mr cruncher who all this timehad been putting on his clothes if i aint what with piety andone blowed thing and another been choused this last week into asbad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with youngjerry dress yourself my boy and while i clean my boots keep a eyeupon your mother now and then and if you see any signs of moreflopping give me a call for i tell you here he addressed his wifeonce more i wont be gone agin in this

the better for itin pocket and its my suspicion that youve been at it from morningto night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket and iwont put up with it aggerawayter and what do you say now  growling in addition such phrases as ah yes youre religioustoo you wouldnt put yourself in opposition to the interests ofyour husband and child would you not you and throwing off othersarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignationmr cruncher betook himself to his bootcleaning and his generalpreparation for business in the meantime his son whose head wasgarnished with tenderer spikes and whose young eyes stood close byone another as his fathers did kept the required watch upon hismother he greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals bydarting out of his sleeping closet where he made his toilet with asuppressed cry of you are going to flop mother halloa fatherand after raising this fictitious alarm darting in again with anundutiful grin  mr crunchers temper was not at all improved when he came to hisbreakfast he resented mrs crunchers saying grace with particularanimosity  now aggerawayter what are you up to at it again  his wife explained that she had merely asked a blessing  dont do it said mr cruncher looking about as if he ratherexpected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wifespetitions i aint a going to be blest out of house and home i wonthave my vittles blest off my table keep still  exceedingly redeyed and grim as if he had been up all night at aparty which had taken anything but a convivial turn jerry cruncherworried his breakfast rather than ate it growling over it like anyfourfooted inmate of a menagerie towards nine oclock he smoothedhis ruffled aspect and presenting as respectable and businesslikean exterior as he could overlay his natural self with issued forth tothe occupation of the day  it could scarcely be called a trade in spite of his favouritedescription of himself as a honest tradesman his stock consisted ofa wooden stool made out of a brokenbacked chair cut down whichstool young jerry walking at his fathers side carried everymorning to beneath the bankinghouse window that was nearest templebar where with the addition of the first handful of straw that couldbe gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet fromthe oddjobmans feet it formed the encampment for the day onthis post of his mr cruncher was as well known to fleetstreet andthe temple as the bar itselfand was almost as illlooking  encamped at a quarter before nine in good time to touch histhreecornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in totellsons jerry took up his station on this windy march morning withyoung jerry standing by him when not engaged in making forays throughthe bar to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute descriptionon passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purposefather and son extremely like each other looking silently on atthe morning traffic in fleetstreet with their two heads as near toone another as the two eyes of each were bore a considerableresemblance to a pair of monkeys the resemblance was not lessenedby the accidental circumstance that the mature jerry bit and spat outstraw while the twinkling eyes of the youthful jerry were asrestlessly watchful of him as of everything else in fleetstreet  the head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached totellsons establishment was put through the door and the word wasgiven  porter wanted  hooray father heres an early job to begin with  having thus given his parent god speed young jerry seated himselfon the stool entered on his reversionary interest in the straw hisfather had been chewing and cogitated  always rusty his fingers is always rusty muttered young jerrywhere does my father get all that iron rust from he dont get noiron rust here  ii  a sight  you know the old bailey well no doubt said one of the oldest ofclerks to jerry the messenger  yees sir returned jerry in something of a dogged manner i doknow the bailey  just so and you know mr lorry  i know mr lorry sir much better than i know the bailey muchbetter said jerry not unlike a reluctant witness at theestablishment in question than i as a honest tradesman wish toknow the bailey  very well find the door where the witnesses go in and show thedoorkeeper this note for mr lorry he will then let you in  into the court sir  into the court  mr crunchers eyes seemed to get a little closer to one anotherand to interchange the inquiry what do you think of this  am i to wait in the court sir he asked as the result of thatconference  i am going to tell you the doorkeeper will pass the note to mrlorry and do you make any gesture that will attract mr lorrysattention and show him where you stand then what you have to do isto remain there until he wants you  is that all sir  thats all he wishes to have a messenger at hand this is totell him you are there  as the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed thenote mr cruncher after surveying him in silence until he came tothe blottingpaper stage remarked  i suppose theyll be trying forgeries this morning  treason  thats quartering said jerry barbarous  it is the law remarked the ancient clerk turning his surprisedspectacles upon him it is the law  its hard in the law to spile a man i think its hard enough tokill him but its very hard to spile him sir  not at all returned the ancient clerk speak well of the lawtake care of your chest and voice my good friend and leave the lawto take care of itself i give you that advice  its the damp sir what settles on my chest and voice saidjerry i leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a livingmine is  well well said the old clerk we an have our various ways ofgaining a livelihood some of us have damp ways and some of us havedry ways here is the letter go along  jerry took the letter and remarking to himself with lessinternal deference than he made an outward show of you are a leanold one too made his bow informed his son in passing of hisdestination and went his way  they hanged at tyburn in those days so the street outsidenewgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has sinceattached to it but the gaol was a vile place in which most kinds ofdebauchery and villainy were practised and where dire diseases werebred that came into court with the prisoners and sometimes rushedstraight from the dock at my lord chief justice himself and pulledhim off the bench it had more than once happened that the judge inthe black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as theprisoners and even died before him for the rest the old bailey wasfamous as a kind of deadly innyard from which pale travellers setout continually in carts and coaches on a violent passage into theother world traversing some two miles and a half of public street androad and shaming few good citizens if any so powerful is use andso desirable to be good use in the beginning it was famous toofor the pillory a wise old institution that inflicted a punishmentof which no one could foresee the extent also for the whippingpostanother dear old institution very humanising and softening tobehold in action also for extensive transactions in bloodmoneyanother fragment of ancestral wisdom systematically leading to themost frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed underheaven altogether the old bailey at that date was a choiceillustration of the precept that whatever is is right anaphorism that would be as final as it is lazy did it not includethe troublesome consequence that nothing that ever was was wrong  making his way through the tainted crowd dispersed up and down thishideous scene of action with the skill of a man accustomed to makehis way quietly the messenger found out the door he sought andhanded in his letter through a trap in it for people then paid tosee the play at the old bailey just as they paid to see the play inbedlamonly the former entertainment was much the dearer thereforeall the old bailey doors were well guarded except indeed the socialdoors by which the criminals got there and those were always leftwide open  after some delay and demur the door grudgingly turned on its hingesa very little way and allowed mr jerry cruncher to squeeze himselfinto court  whats on he asked in a whisper of the man he found himselfnext to  nothing yet  whats coming on  the treason case  the quartering one eh  ah returned the man with a relish hell be drawn on a hurdleto be half hanged and then hell be taken down and sliced beforehis own face and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while helooks on and then his head will be chopped off and hell be cut intoquarters thats the sentence  if hes found guilty you mean to say jerry added by way ofproviso  oh theyll find him guilty said the other dont you beafraid of that  mr crunchers attention was here diverted to the doorkeeperwhom he saw making his way to mr lorry with the note in his handmr lorry sat at a table among the gentlemen in wigs not far froma wigged gentleman the prisoners counsel who had a great bundleof papers before him and nearly opposite another wigged gentlemanwith his hands in his pockets whose whole attention when mrcruncher looked at him then or afterwards seemed to be concentratedon the ceiling of the court after some gruff coughing and rubbingof his chin and signing with his hand jerry attracted the notice ofmr lorry who had stood up to look for him and who quietly noddedand sat down again  whats he got to do with the case asked the man he had spokenwith  blest if i know said jerry  what have you got to do with it then if a person may inquire  blest if i know that either said jerry  the entrance of the judge and a consequent great stir andsettling down in the court stopped the dialogue presently thedock became the central point of interest two gaolers who had beenstanding there went out and the prisoner was brought in and putto the bar  everybody present except the one wigged gentleman who looked at theceiling stared at him all the human breath in the place rolled athim like a sea or a wind or a fire eager faces strained roundpillars and comers to get a sight of him spectators in back rowsstood up not to miss a hair of him people on the floor of the courtlaid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them to helpthemselves at anybodys cost to a view of him stood atiptoe gotupon ledges stood upon next to nothing to see every inch of himconspicuous among these latter like an animated bit of the spikedwall of newgate jerry stood aiming at the prisoner the beerybreath of a whet he had taken as he came along and discharging itto mingle with the waves of other beer and gin and tea andcoffee and what not that flowed at him and already broke upon thegreat windows behind him in an impure mist and rain  the object of all this staring and blaring was a young man of aboutfiveandtwenty wellgrown and welllooking with a sunburnt cheekand a dark eye his condition was that of a young gentleman he wasplainly dressed in black or very dark grey and his hair which waslong and dark was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neckmore to be out of his way than for ornament as an emotion of the mindwill express itself through any covering of the body so thepaleness which his situation engendered came through the brown uponhis cheek showing the soul to be stronger than the sun he wasotherwise quite selfpossessed bowed to the judge and stood quiet  the sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed atwas not a sort that elevated humanity had he stood in peril of a lesshorrible sentence had there been a chance of any one of its savagedetails being spared by just so much would he have lost in hisfascination the form that was to be doomed to be so shamefullymangled was the sight the immortal creature that was to be sobutchered and torn asunder yielded the sensation whatever glossthe various spectators put upon the interest according to theirseveral arts and powers of selfdeceit the interest was at theroot of it ogreish  silence in the court charles darnay had yesterday pleaded notguilty to an indictment denouncing him with infinite jingle andjangle for that he was a false traitor to our serene illustriousexcellent and so forth prince our lord the king by reason of hishaving on divers occasions and by divers means and ways assistedlewis the french king in his wars against our said sereneillustrious excellent and so forth that was to

becomingmore and more spiky as the law terms bristled it made out with hugesatisfaction and so arrived circuitously at the understanding thatthe aforesaid and over and over again aforesaid charles darnaystood there before him upon his trial that the jury were swearing inand that mr attorneygeneral was making ready to speak  the accused who was and who knew he was being mentally hangedbeheaded and quartered by everybody there neither flinched from thesituation nor assumed any theatrical air in it he was quiet andattentive watched the opening proceedings with a grave interestand stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him socomposedly that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with whichit was strewn the court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkledwith vinegar as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever  over the prisoners head there was a mirror to throw the light downupon him crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflectedin it and had passed from its surface and this earths togetherhaunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would havebeen if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections asthe ocean is one day to give up its dead some passing thought ofthe infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved may havestruck the prisoners mind be that as it may a change in hisposition making him conscious of a bar of light across his face helooked up and when he saw the glass his face flushed and his righthand pushed the herbs away  it happened that the action turned his face to that side of thecourt which was on his left about on a level with his eyes theresat in that corner of the judges bench two persons upon whom hislook immediately rested so immediately and so much to the changingof his aspect that all the eyes that were turned upon him turnedto them  the spectators saw in the two figures a young lady of little morethan twenty and a gentleman who was evidently her father a man ofa very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness ofhis hair and a certain indescribable intensity of face not of anactive kind but pondering and selfcommuning when this expressionwas upon him he looked as if he were old but when it was stirred andbroken up as it was now in a moment on his speaking to hisdaughter he became a handsome man not past the prime of life  his daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm as shesat by him and the other pressed upon it she had drawn close to himin her dread of the scene and in her pity for the prisoner herforehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror andcompassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused this hadbeen so very noticeable so very powerfully and naturally shownthat starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her andthe whisper went about who are they  jerry the messenger who had made his own observations in hisown manner and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in hisabsorption stretched his neck to hear who they were the crowdabout him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearestattendant and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passedback at last it got to jerry  witnesses  for which side  against  against what side  the prisoners  the judge whose eyes had gone in the general direction recalledthem leaned back in his seat and looked steadily at the man whoselife was in his hand as mr attorneygeneral rose to spin the ropegrind the axe and hammer the nails into the scaffold  iii  a disappointment  mr attorneygeneral had to inform the jury that the prisonerbefore them though young in years was old in the treasonablepractices which claimed the forfeit of his life that thiscorrespondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence oftoday or of yesterday or even of last year or of the yearbefore that it was certain the prisoner had for longer than thatbeen in the habit of passing and repassing between france and englandon secret business of which he could give no honest account thatif it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive which happilyit never was the real wickedness and guilt of his business mighthave remained undiscovered that providence however had put itinto the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach toferret out the nature of the prisoners schemes and struck withhorror to disclose them to his majestys chief secretary of state andmost honourable privy council that this patriot would be producedbefore them that his position and attitude were on the wholesublime that he had been the prisoners friend but at once in anauspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy had resolved toimmolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom on thesacred altar of his country that if statues were decreed in britainas in ancient greece and rome to public benefactors this shiningcitizen would assuredly have had one that as they were not sodecreed he probably would not have one that virtue as had beenobserved by the poets in many passages which he well knew the jurywould have word for word at the tips of their tongues whereat thejurys countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knewnothing about the passages was in a manner contagious moreespecially the bright virtue known as patriotism or love ofcountry that the lofty example of this immaculate andunimpeachable witness for the crown to refer to whom howeverunworthily was an honour had communicated itself to the prisonersservant and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine hismasters tabledrawers and pockets and secrete his papers that hemr attorneygeneral was prepared to hear some disparagementattempted of this admirable servant but that in a general way hepreferred him to his mr attorneygenerals brothers and sistersand honoured him more than his mr attorneygenerals father andmother that he called with confidence on the jury to come and dolikewise that the evidence of these two witnesses coupled withthe documents of their discovering that would be produced wouldshow the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his majestysforces and of their disposition and preparation both by sea andland and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed suchinformation to a hostile power that these lists could not beproved to be in the prisoners handwriting but that it was all thesame that indeed it was rather the better for the prosecution asshowing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions that theproof would go back five years and would show the prisoner alreadyengaged in these pernicious missions within a few weeks before thedate of the very first action fought between the british troops andthe americans that for these reasons the jury being a loyal juryas he knew they were and being a responsible jury as they knewthey were must positively find the prisoner guilty and make anend of him whether they liked it or not that they never could laytheir heads upon their pillows that they never could tolerate theidea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows thatthey never could endure the notion of their children laying theirheads upon their pillows in short that there never more could befor them or theirs any laying of heads upon pillows at all unlessthe prisoners head was taken off that head mr attorneygeneralconcluded by demanding of them in the name of everything he couldthink of with a round turn in it and on the faith of his solemnasseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as deadand gone  when the attorneygeneral ceased a buzz arose in the court as ifa cloud of great blueflies were swarming about the prisoner inanticipation of what he was soon to become when toned down again theunimpeachable patriot appeared in the witnessbox  mr solicitorgeneral then following his leaders lead examinedthe patriot john barsad gentleman by name the story of his puresoul was exactly what mr attorneygeneral had described it to beperhaps if it had a fault a little too exactly having releasedhis noble bosom of its burden he would have modestly withdrawnhimself but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before himsitting not far from mr lorry begged to ask him a few questions thewigged gentleman sitting opposite still looking at the ceiling of thecourt  had he ever been a spy himself no he scorned the base insinuationwhat did he live upon his property where was his property he didntprecisely remember where it was what was it no business ofanybodys had he inherited it yes he had from whom distantrelation very distant rather ever been in prison certainly notnever in a debtors prison didnt see what that had to do with itnever in a debtors prison come once again never yes how manytimes two or three times not five or six perhaps of whatprofession gentleman ever been kicked might have beenfrequently no ever kicked downstairs decidedly not once received akick on the top of a staircase and fell downstairs of his ownaccord kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice something tothat effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed theassault but it was not true swear it was not true positivelyever live by cheating at play never ever live by play not more thanother gentlemen do ever borrow money of the prisoner yes ever payhim no was not this intimacy with the prisoner in reality a veryslight one forced upon the prisoner in coaches inns and packetsno sure he saw the prisoner with these lists certain knew no moreabout the lists no had not procured them himself for instanceno expect to get anything by this evidence no not in regulargovernment pay and employment to lay traps oh dear no or to doanything oh dear no swear that over and over again no motivesbut motives of sheer patriotism none whatever  the virtuous servant roger cly swore his way through the case at agreat rate he had taken service with the prisoner in good faithand simplicity four years ago he had asked the prisoner aboardthe calais packet if he wanted a handy fellow and the prisoner hadengaged him he had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow asan act of charity never thought of such a thing he began to havesuspicions of the prisoner and to keep an eye upon him soonafterwards in arranging his clothes while travelling he had seensimilar lists to these in the prisoners pockets over and over againhe had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoners desk hehad not put them there first he had seen the prisoner show theseidentical lists to french gentlemen at calais and similar lists tofrench gentlemen both at calais and boulogne he loved his countryand couldnt bear it and had given information he had never beensuspected of stealing a silver teapot he had been malignedrespecting a mustardpot but it turned out to be only a plated onehe had known the last witness seven or eight years that was merelya coincidence he didnt call it a particularly curious coincidencemost coincidences were curious neither did he call it a curiouscoincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too he was atrue briton and hoped there were many like him  the blueflies buzzed again and mr attorneygeneral called mrjarvis lorry  mr jarvis lorry are you a clerk in tellsons bank  i am  on a certain friday night in november one thousand seven hundredand seventyfive did business occasion you to travel between londonand dover by the mail  it did  were there any other passengers in the mail  two  did they alight on the road in the course of the night  they did  mr lorry look upon the prisoner was he one of those twopassengers  i cannot undertake to say that he was  does he resemble either of these two passengers  both were so wrapped up and the night was so dark and we were allso reserved that i cannot undertake to say even that  mr lorry look again upon the prisoner supposing him wrapped upas those two passengers were is there anything in his bulk andstature to render it unlikely that he was one of them  no  you will not swear mr lorry that he was not one of them  no  so at least you say he may have been one of them  yes except that i remember them both to have been like myselftimorous of highwaymen and the prisoner has not a timorous air  did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity mr lorry  i certainly have seen that  mr lorry look once more upon the prisoner have you seen himto your certain knowledge before  i have  when  i was returning from france a few days afterwards and atcalais the prisoner came on board the packetship in which ireturned and made the voyage with me  at what hour did he come on board  at a little after midnight  in the dead of the night was he the only passenger who came onboard at that untimely hour  he happened to be the only one  never mind about happening mr lorry he was the onlypassenger who came on board in the dead of the night  he was  were you travelling alone mr lorry or with any companion  with two companions a gentleman and lady they are here  they are here had you any conversation with the prisoner  hardly any the weather was stormy and the passage long and roughand i lay on a sofa almost from shore to shore  miss manette  the young lady to whom all eyes had been turned before and werenow turned again stood up where she had sat her father rose withher and kept her hand drawn through his arm  miss manette look upon the prisoner  to be confronted with such pity and such earnest youth andbeauty was far more trying to the accused than to be confrontedwith all the crowd standing as it were apart with her on the edgeof his grave not all the staring curiosity that looked on could forthe moment nerve him to remain quite still his hurried right handparcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in agarden and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shookthe lips from which the colour rushed to his heart the buzz of thegreat flies was loud again  miss manette have you seen the prisoner before  yes sir  where  on board of the packetship just now referred to sir and on thesame occasion  you are the young lady just now referred to  o most unhappily i am  the plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musicalvoice of the judge as he said something fiercely answer thequestions put to you and make no remark upon them  miss manette had you any conversation with the prisoner on thatpassage across the channel  yes sir  recall it  in the midst of a profound stillness she faintly began  when the gentleman came on board  do you mean the prisoner inquired the judge knitting his brows  yes my lord  then say the prisoner  when the prisoner came on board he noticed that my fatherturning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her was muchfatigued and in a very weak state of health my father was soreduced that i was afraid to take him out of the air and i had made abed for him on the deck near the cabin steps and i sat on the deck athis side to take care of him there were no other passengers thatnight but we four the prisoner was so good as to beg permission toadvise me how i could shelter my father from the wind and weatherbetter than i had done i had not known how to do it well notunderstanding how the wind would set when we were out of theharbour he did it for me he expressed great gentleness andkindness for my fathers state and i am sure he felt it that was themanner of our beginning to speak together  let me interrupt you for a moment had he come on board alone  no  how many were with him  two french gentlemen  had they conferred together  they had conferred together until the last moment when it wasnecessary for the french gentlemen to be landed in their boat  had any papers been handed about among them similar to theselists  some papers had been handed about among them but i dont know whatpapers  like these in shape and size  possibly but indeed i dont know although they stood whisperingvery near to me because they stood at the top of the cabin steps tohave the light of the lamp that was hanging there it was a dull lampand they spoke very low and i did not hear what they said and sawonly that they looked at papers  now to the prisoners conversation miss manette  the prisoner was as open in his confidence with me which arose outof my helpless situation as he was kind and good and useful to myfather i hope bursting into tears i may not repay him by doinghim harm today  buzzing from the blueflies  miss manette if the prisoner does not perfectly understand thatyou give the evidence which it is your duty to give which you mustgive and which you cannot escape from giving with greatunwillingness he is the only person present in that condition pleaseto go on  he told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate anddifficult nature which might get people into trouble and that he wastherefore travelling under an assumed name he said that this businesshad within a few days taken him to france and might atintervals take him backwards and forwards between france andengland for a long time to come  did he say anything about america miss manette be particular  he tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen and hesaid that so far as he could judge it was a wrong and foolish one onenglands part he added in a jesting way that perhaps georgewashington might gain almost as great a name in history as georgethe third but there was no harm in his way of saying this it wassaid laughingly and to beguile the time  any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chiefactor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directedwill be unconsciously imitated by the spectators her forehead waspainfully anxious and instent as she gave this evidence and in thepauses when she stopped for the judge to write it down watched itseffect upon the counsel for and against among the lookerson therewas the same expression in all quarters of the court insomuch that agreat majority of the foreheads there might have been mirrorsreflecting the witness when the judge looked up from his notes toglare at that tremendous heresy about george washington  mr attorneygeneral now signified to my lord that he deemed itnecessary as a matter of precaution and form to call the youngladys father doctor manette who was called accordingly  doctor manette look upon the prisoner have you ever seen himbefore  once when he called at my lodgings in london some three years orthree years and a half ago  can you identify him as your fellowpassenger on board thepacket or speak to his conversation with your daughter  sir i can do neither  is there any particular and special reason for your being unable todo either  he answered in a low voice there is  has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment withouttrial or even accusation in your native country doctor manette  he answered in a tone that went to every heart a longimprisonment  were you newly released on the occasion in question  they tell me so  have you no remembrance of the occasion  none my mind is a blank from some time i cannot even say whattime when i employed myself in my captivity in making shoes to thetime when i found myself living in london with my dear daughterhere she had become familiar to me when a gracious god restored myfaculties but i am quite unable even to say how she had becomefamiliar i have no remembrance of the process  mr attorneygeneral sat down and the father and daughter satdown together  a singular circumstance then arose in the case the object in handbeing to show that the prisoner went down with some fellowplotteruntracked in the dover mail on that friday night in november fiveyears ago and got out of the mail in the night as a blind at aplace where he did not remain but from which he travelled back somedozen miles or more to a garrison and dockyard and there collectedinformation a witness was called to identify him as having been atthe precise time required in the coffeeroom of an hotel in thatgarrisonanddockyard town waiting for another person the prisonerscounsel was crossexamining this witness with no result except thathe had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion when thewigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceilingof the court wrote a word or two on a little piece of paperscrewed it up and tossed it to him opening this piece of paper inthe next pause the counsel looked with great attention andcuriosity at the prisoner  you say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner  the witness was quite sure  did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner  not so like the witness said as that he could be mistaken  look well upon that gentleman my learned friend there pointingto him who had tossed the paper over and then look well upon theprisoner how say you are they very like each other  allowing for my learned friends appearance being careless andslovenly if not debauched they were sufficiently like each other tosurprise not only the witness but everybody present when theywere thus brought into comparison my lord being prayed to bid mylearned friend lay aside his wig and giving no very gracious consentthe likeness became much more remarkable my lord inquired of mrstryver the prisoners counsel whether they were next to try mrcarton name of my learned friend for treason but mr stryverreplied to my lord no but he would ask the witness to tell himwhether what happened once might happen twice whether he wouldhave been so confident if he had seen this illustration of hisrashness sooner whether he would be so confident having seen it andmore the upshot of which was to smash this witness like acrockery vessel and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber  mr cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off hisfingers in his following of the evidence he had now to attend whilemr stryver fitted the prisoners case on the jury like a compactsuit of clothes showing them how the patriot barsad was a hired spyand traitor an unblushing trafficker in blood and one of thegreatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed judas which hecertainly did look rather like how the virtuous servant cly was hisfriend and partner and was worthy to be how the watchful eyes ofthose forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as avictim because some family affairs in france he being of frenchextraction did require his making those passages across thechannel though what those affairs were a consideration for otherswho were near and dear to him forbade him even for his life todisclose how the evidence that had been warped and wrested from theyoung lady whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed came tonothing involving the mere little innocent gallantries andpolitenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young ladyso thrown together with the exception of that reference to georgewashington which was altogether too extravagant and impossible tobe regarded in any other fight than as a monstrous joke how itwould be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt topractise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies andfears and therefore mr attorneygeneral had made the most of ithow nevertheless it rested upon nothing save that vile and infamouscharacter of evidence too often disfiguring such cases and of whichthe state trials of this country were full but there my lordinterposed with as grave a face as if it had not been true sayingthat he could not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions  mr stryver then called his few witnesses and mr cruncher had nextto attend while mr attorneygeneral turned the whole suit ofclothes mr stryver had fitted on the jury inside out showing howbarsad and cly were even a hundred times better than he had thoughtthem and the prisoner a hundred times worse lastly came my lordhimself turning the suit of clothes now inside out now outsidein but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them intograveclothes for the prisoner  and now the jury turned to consider and the great flies swarmedagain  mr carton who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the courtchanged neither his place nor his attitude even in this excitementwhile his learned friend mr stryver massing his papers beforehim whispered with those who sat near and from time to timeglanced anxiously at the jury while all the spectators moved moreor less and grouped themselves anew while even my lord himself arosefrom his seat and slowly paced up and down his platform notunattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that hisstate was feverish this one man sat leaning back with his torngown half off him his untidy wig put on just as it had happened tolight on his head after its removal his hands in his pockets and hiseyes on the ceiling as they had been all day something especiallyreckless in his demeanour not only gave him a disreputable lookbut so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to theprisoner which his momentary earnestness when they were comparedtogether had strengthened that many of the lookerson takingnote of him now said to one another they would hardly have thoughtthe two were so alike mr cruncher made the observation to his nextneighbour and added id hold half a guinea that he dont get nolawwork to do dont look like the sort of one to get any do he  yet this mr carton took in more of the details of the scene thanhe appeared to take in for now when miss manettes head dropped uponher fathers breast he was the first to see it and to say audiblyofficer look to that young lady help the gentleman to take her outdont you see she will fall  there was much commiseration for her as she was removed and muchsympathy with her father it had evidently been a great distress tohim to have the days of his imprisonment recalled he had shownstrong internal agitation when he was questioned and that ponderingor brooding look which made him old had been upon him like a heavycloud ever since as he passed out the jury who had turned back andpaused a moment spoke through their foreman  they were not agreed and wished to retire my lord perhaps withgeorge washington on his mind showed some surprise that they were notagreed but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watchand ward and retired himself the trial had lasted all day and thelamps in the court were now being lighted it began to be rumouredthat the jury would be out a long while the spectators dropped off toget refreshment and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dockand sat down  mr lorry who had gone out when the young lady and her fatherwent out now reappeared and beckoned to jerry who in the slackenedinterest could easily get near him  jerry if you wish to take something to eat you can but keepin the way you will be sure to hear when the jury come in dont be amoment behind them for i want you to take the verdict back to thebank you are the quickest messenger i know and will get to templebar long before i can  jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle and he knuckled it inacknowledgment of this communication and a shilling mr carton cameup at the moment and touched mr lorry on the arm  how is the young lady  she is greatly distressed but her father is comforting her andshe feels the better for being out of court  ill tell the prisoner so it wont do for a respectable bankgentleman like you to be seen speaking to him publicly you know  mr lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated thepoint in his mind and mr carton made his way to the outside of thebar the way out of court lay in that direction and jerry followedhim all eyes ears and spikes  mr darnay  the prisoner came forward directly  you will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness miss manetteshe will do very well you have seen the worst of her agitation  i am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it could you tellher so for me with my fervent acknowledgments  yes i could i will if you ask it  mr cartons manner was so careless as to be almost insolent hestood half turned from the prisoner lounging with his elbowagainst the bar  i do ask it accept my cordial thanks  what said carton still only half turned towards him do youexpect mr darnay  the worst  its the wisest thing to expect and the likeliest but i thinktheir withdrawing is in your favour  loitering on the way out of court not being allowed jerry heardno more but left them so like each other in feature so unlikeeach other in manner standing side by side both reflected in theglass above them  an hour and a half limped heavily away in the thiefandrascalcrowded passages below even though assisted off with mutton piesand ale the hoarse messenger uncomfortably seated on a form aftertaking that refection had dropped into a doze when a loud murmur anda rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the courtcarried him along with them  jerry jerry mr lorry was already calling at the door when hegot there  here sir its a fight to get back again here i am sir  mr lorry handed him a paper through the throng quick have yougot it  yes sir  hastily written on the paper was the word aquitted  if you had sent the message recalled to life again mutteredjerry as he turned i should have known what you meant this time  he had no opportunity of saying or so much as thinking anythingelse until he was clear of the old bailey for the crowd camepouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs anda loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blueflies weredispersing in search of other carrion  iv  congratulatory  from the dimlylighted passages of the court the last sediment ofthe human stew that had been boiling there all day was straining offwhen doctor manette lucie manette his daughter mr lorry thesolicitor for the defence and its counsel mr stryver stoodgathered round mr charles darnay just released congratulating himon his escape from death  it would have been difficult by a far brighter light to recognisein doctor manette intellectual of face and upright of bearing theshoemaker of the garret in paris yet no one could have looked at himtwice without looking again even though the opportunity ofobservation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his lowgrave voice and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfullywithout any apparent reason while one external cause and that areference to his long lingering agony would always as on thetrial evoke this condition from the depths of his soul it was alsoin its nature to arise of itself and to draw a gloom over him asincomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they hadseen the shadow of the actual bastille thrown upon him by a summersun when the substance was three hundred miles away  only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding fromhis mind she was the golden thread that united him to a past beyondhis misery and to a present beyond his misery and the sound of hervoice the light of her face the touch of her hand had a strongbeneficial influence with him almost always not absolutely alwaysfor she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed butthey were few and slight and she believed them over  mr darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully and hadturned to mr stryver whom he warmly thanked mr stryver a man oflittle more than thirty but looking twenty years older than he wasstout loud red bluff and free from any drawback of delicacy had apushing way of shouldering himself morally and physically intocompanies and conversations that argued well for his shoulderinghis way up in life  he still had his wig and gown on and he said squaring himself athis late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent mr lorryclean out of the group i am glad to have brought you off withhonour mr darnay it was an infamous prosecution grosslyinfamous but not the less likely to succeed on that account  you have laid me under an obligation to you for life in twosenses said his late client taking his hand  i have done my best for you mr darnay and my best is as goodas another mans i believe  it clearly being incumbent on some one to say much better mrlorry said it perhaps not quite disinterestedly but with theinterested object of squeezing himself back again  you think so said mr stryver well you have been present allday and you ought to know you are a man of business too  and as such quoth mr lorry whom the counsel learned in thelaw had now shouldered back into the group just as he hadpreviously shouldered him out of it as such i will appeal todoctor manette to break up this conference and order us all to ourhomes miss lucie looks ill mr darnay has had a terrible day we areworn out  speak for yourself mr lorry said stryver i have a nightswork to do yet speak for yourself  i speak for myself answered mr lorry and for mr darnay andfor miss lucie and miss lucie do you not think i may speak for usall he asked her the question pointedly and with a glance at herfather  his face had become frozen as it were in a very curious look atdarnay an intent look deepening into a frown of dislike anddistrust not even unmixed with fear with this strange expressionon him his thoughts had wandered away  my father said lucie softly laying her hand on his  he slowly shook the shadow off and turned to her  shall we go home my father  with a long breath he answered yes  the friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed under theimpression which he himself had originated that he would not bereleased that night the lights were nearly all extinguished in thepassages the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattleand the dismal place was deserted until tomorrow mornings interestof gallows pillory whippingpost and brandingiron should repeopleit walking between her father and mr darnay lucie manette passedinto the open air a hackneycoach was called and the father anddaughter departed in it  mr stryver had left them in the passages to shoulder his wayback to the robingroom another person who had not joined the groupor interchanged a word with any one of them but who had beenleaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest had silentlystrolled out after the rest and had looked on until the coach droveaway he now stepped up to where mr lorry and mr darnay stood uponthe pavement  so mr lorry men of business may speak to mr darnay now  nobody had made any acknowledgment of mr cartons part in the daysproceedings nobody had known of it he was unrobed and was nonethe better for it in appearance  if you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind whenthe business mind is divided between goodnatured impulse and businessappearances you would be amused mr darnay  mr lorry reddened and said warmly you have mentioned thatbefore sir we men of business who serve a house are not our ownmasters we have to think of the house more than ourselves  i know i know rejoined mr carton carelessly dont benettled mr lorry you are as good as another i have no doubtbetter i dare say  and indeed sir pursued mr lorry not minding him i reallydont know what you have to do with the matter if youll excuse meas very much your elder for saying so i really dont know that it isyour business  business bless you i have no business said mr carton  it is a pity you have not sir  i think so too  if you had pursued mr lorry perhaps you would attend to it  lord love you no i shouldnt said mr carton  well sir cried mr lorry thoroughly heated by his indifferencebusiness is a very good thing and a very respectable thing andsir if business imposes its restraints and its silences andimpediments mr darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows howto make allowance for that circumstance mr darnay good night godbless you sir i hope you have been this day preserved for aprosperous and happy life chair there  perhaps a little angry with himself as well the barrister mrlorry bustled into the chair and was carried off to tellsonscarton who smelt of port wine and did not appear to be quitesober laughed then and turned to darnay  this is a strange chance that throws you and me together this mustbe a strange night to you standing alone here with your counterparton these street stones  i hardly seem yet returned charles darnay to belong to thisworld again  i dont wonder at it its not so long since you were pretty faradvanced on your way to another you speak faintly  i begin to think i am faint  then why the devil dont you dine i dined myself while thosenumskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to this orsome other let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at  drawing his arm through his own he took him down ludgatehill tofleetstreet and so up a covered way into a tavern here they wereshown into a little room where charles darnay was soon recruiting hisstrength with a good plain dinner and good wine while carton satopposite to him at the same table with his separate bottle of portbefore him and his fully halfinsolent manner upon him  do you feel yet that you belong to this terrestrial scheme againmr darnay  i am frightfully confused regarding time and place but i am so farmended as to feel that  it must be an immense satisfaction  he said it bitterly and filled up his glass again which was alarge one  as to me the greatest desire i have is to forget that i belong toit it bas no good in it for me except wine like this nor i forit so we are not much alike in that particular indeed i begin tothink we are not much alike in any particular you and i  confused by the emotion of the day and feeling his being there withthis double of coarse deportment to be like a dream charles darnaywas at a loss how to answer finally answered not at all  now your dinner is done carton presently said why dont youcall a health mr darnay why dont you give your toast  what health what toast  why its on the tip of your tongue it ought to be it must beill swear its there  miss manette then  miss manette then  looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toastcarton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall where itshivered to pieces then rang the bell and ordered in another  thats a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark mrdarnay he said filling his new goblet  a slight frown and a laconic yes were the answer  thats a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by howdoes it feel is it worth being tried for ones life to be the objectof such sympathy and compassion mr darnay  again darnay answered not a word  she was mightily pleased to have your message when i gave ither not that she showed she was pleased but i suppose she was  the allusion served as a timely reminder to darnay that thisdisagreeable companion had of his own free will assisted him inthe strait of the day he turned the dialogue to that point andthanked him for it  i neither want any thanks nor merit any was the carelessrejoinder it was nothing to do in the first place and i dont knowwhy i did it in the second mr darnay let me ask you a question  willingly and a small return for your good offices  do you think i particularly like you  really mr carton returned the other oddly disconcerted ihave not asked myself the question  but ask yourself the question now  you have acted as if you do but i dont think you do  i dont think i do said carton i begin to have a very goodopinion of your understanding  nevertheless pursued darnay rising to ring the bell there isnothing in that i hope to prevent my calling the reckoning andour parting without illblood on either side  carton rejoining nothing in life darnay rang do you call thewhole reckoning said carton on his answering in the affirmativethen bring me another pint of this same wine drawer and come andwake me at ten  the bill being paid charles darnay rose and wished him goodnight without returning the wish carton rose too with somethingof a threat of defiance in his manner and said a last word mrdarnay you think i am drunk  i think you have been drinking mr carton  think you know i have been drinking  since i must say so i know it  then you shall likewise know why i am a disappointed drudgesir i care for no man on earth and no man on earth cares for me  much to be regretted you might have used your talents better  may be so mr darnay may be not dont let your sober faceelate you however you dont know what it may come to good night  when he was left alone this strange being took up a candle went toa glass that hung against the wall and surveyed himself minutely init  do you particularly like the man he muttered at his own imagewhy should you particularly like a man who resembles you there isnothing in you to like you know that ah confound you what a changeyou have made in yourself a good reason for taking to a man thathe shows you what you have fallen away from and what you might havebeen change places with him and would you have been looked at bythose blue eyes as he was and commiserated by that agitated face ashe was come on and have it out in plain words you hate the fellow  he resorted to his pint of wine for consolation drank it all in afew minutes and fell asleep on his arms with his hair stragglingover the table and a long windingsheet in the candle dripping downupon him  v  the jackal  those were drinking days and most men drank hard so very greatis the improvement time has brought about in such habits that amoderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one manwould swallow in the course of a night without any detriment to hisreputation as a perfect gentleman would seem in these days aridiculous exaggeration the learned profession of the law wascertainly not behind any other learned profession in itsbacchanalian propensities neither was mr stryver already fastshouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice behind hiscompeers in this particular any more than in the drier parts of thelegal race  a favourite at the old bailey and eke at the sessions mrstryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of theladder on which he mounted sessions and old bailey had now tosummon their favourite specially to their longing arms andshouldering itself towards the visage of the lord chief justice in thecourt of kings bench the florid countenance of mr stryver mightbe daily seen bursting out of the bed of wigs like a great sunflowerpushing its way at the sun from among a rank gardenfull of flaringcompanions  it had once been noted at the bar that while mr stryver was a glibman and an unscrupulous and a ready and a bold he had not thatfaculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements whichis among the most striking and necessary of the advocatesaccomplishments but a remarkable improvement came upon him as tothis the more business he got the greater his power seemed to growof getting at its pith and marrow and however late at night he satcarousing with sydney carton he always had his points at his fingersends in the morning  sydney carton idlest and most unpromising of men was stryversgreat ally what the two drank together between hilary term andmichaelmas might have floated a kings ship stryver never had a casein hand anywhere but carton was there with his hands in hispockets staring at the ceiling of the court they went the samecircuit and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late intothe night and carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day going homestealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings like a dissipated cat atlast it began to get about among such as were interested in thematter that although sydney carton would never be a lion he was anamazingly good jackal and that he rendered suit and service tostryver in that humble capacity  ten oclock sir said the man at the tavern whom he hadcharged to wake him ten oclock sir  whats the matter  ten oclock sir  what do you mean ten oclock at night  yes sir your honour told me to call you  oh i remember very well very well  after a few dull efforts to get to sleep again which the mandexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for fiveminutes he got up tossed his hat on and walked out he turnedinto the temple and having revived himself by twice pacing thepavements of kings benchwalk and paperbuildings turned into thestryver chambers  the stryver clerk who never assisted at these conferences had gonehome and the stryver principal opened the door he had his slipperson and a loose bedgown and his throat was bare for his greaterease he had that rather wild strained seared marking about theeyes which may be observed in all free livers of his class fromthe portrait of jeffries downward and which can be traced undervarious disguises of art through the portraits of every drinking age  you are a little late memory said stryver  about the usual time it may be a quarter of an hour later  they went into a dingy room lined with books and littered withpapers where there was a blazing fire a kettle steamed upon the hoband in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone with plentyof wine upon it and brandy and rum and sugar and lemons  you have had your bottle i perceive sydney  two tonight i think i have been dining with the days client orseeing him dine its all one  that was a rare point sydney that you brought to bear upon theidentification how did you come by it when did it strike you  i thought he was rather a handsome fellow and i thought i shouldhave been much the same sort of fellow if i had had any luck  mr stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch  you and your luck sydney get to work get to work  sullenly enough the jackal loosened his dress went into anadjoining room and came back with a large jug of cold water a basinand a towel or two steeping the towels in the water and partiallywringing them out he folded them on his head in a manner hideous tobehold sat down at the table and said now i am ready  not much boiling down to be done tonight memory said mrstryver gaily as he looked among his papers  how much  only two sets of them  give me the worst first  there they are sydney fire away  the lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one sideof the drinkingtable while the jackal sat at his ownpaperbestrewn table proper on the other side of it with the bottlesand glasses ready to his hand both resorted to the drinkingtablewithout stint but each in a different way the lion for the most partreclining with his hands in his waistband looking at the fire oroccasionally flirting with some lighter document the jackal withknitted brows and intent face so deep in his task that his eyesdid not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass whichoften groped about for a minute or more before it found the glassfor his lips two or three times the matter in hand became so knottythat the jackal found it imperative on him to get up and steep histowels anew from these pilgrimages to the jug and basin hereturned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words candescribe which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity  at length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lionand proceeded to offer it to him the lion took it with care andcaution made his selections from it and his remarks upon it and thejackal assisted both when the repast was fully discussed the lionput his hands in his waistband again and lay down to mediate thejackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle anda fresh application to his head and applied himself to the collectionof a second meal this was administered to the lion in the samemanner and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in themorning  and now we have done sydney fill a bumper of punch said mrstryver  the jackal removed the towels from his head which had been steamingagain shook himself yawned shivered and complied  you were very sound sydney in the matter of those crown witnessestoday every question told  i always am sound am i not  i dont gainsay it what has roughened your temper put somepunch to it and smooth it again  with a deprecatory grunt the jackal again complied  the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school said stryvernodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and thepast the old seesaw sydney up one minute and down the next nowin spirits and now in despondency  ah returned the other sighing yes the same sydney with thesame luck even then i did exercises for other boys and seldom didmy own  and why not  god knows it was my way i suppose  he sat with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched outbefore him looking at the fire  carton said his friend squaring himself at him with a bullyingair as if the firegrate had been the furnace in which sustainedendeavour was forged and the one delicate thing to be done for theold sydney carton of old shrewsbury school was to shoulder him intoit your way is and always was a lame way you summon no energy andpurpose look at me  oh botheration returned sydney with a lighter and moregoodhumoured laugh dont you be moral  how have i done what i have done said stryver how do i dowhat i do  partly through paying me to help you i suppose but its not worthyour while to apostrophise me or the air about it what you wantto do you do you were always in the front rank and i was alwaysbehind  i had to get into the front rank i was not born there was i  i was not present at the ceremony but my opinion is you weresaid carton at this he laughed again and they both laughed  before shrewsbury and at shrewsbury and ever since shrewsburypursued carton you have fallen into your rank and i have falleninto mine even when we were fellowstudents in the studentquarter ofparis picking up french and french law and other french crumbs thatwe didnt get much good of you were always somewhere and i wasalways nowhere  and whose fault was that  upon my soul i am not sure that it was not yours you werealways driving and riving and shouldering and passing to thatrestless degree that i had no chance for my life but in rust andrepose its a gloomy thing however to talk about ones own pastwith the day breaking turn me in some other direction before i go  well then pledge me to the pretty witness said stryverholding up his glass are you turned in a pleasant direction  apparently not for he became gloomy again  pretty witness he muttered looking down into his glass ihave had enough of witnesses today and tonight whos your prettywitness  the picturesque doctors daughter miss manette  she pretty  is she not  no  why man alive she was the admiration of the whole court  rot the admiration of the whole court who made the old bailey ajudge of beauty she was a goldenhaired doll  do you know sydney said mr stryver looking at him with sharpeyes and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face do youknow i rather thought at the time that you sympathised with thegoldenhaired doll and were quick to see what happened to thegoldenhaired doll  quick to see what happened if a girl doll or no doll swoonswithin a yard or two of a mans nose he can see it without aperspectiveglass i pledge you but i deny the beauty and now illhave no more drink ill get to bed  when his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle tolight him down the stairs the day was coldly looking in through itsgrimy windows when he got out of the house the air was cold and sadthe dull sky overcast the river dark and dim the whole scene likea lifeless desert and wreaths of dust were spinning round and roundbefore the morning blast as if the desertsand had risen far awayand the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm thecity  waste forces within him and a desert all around this man stoodstill on his way across a silent terrace and saw for a momentlying in the wilderness before him a mirage honourable ambitionselfdenial and perseverance in the fair city of this visionthere were airy galleries from which the loves and graces lookedupon him gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening waters ofhope that sparkled in his sight a moment and it was gone climbingto a high chamber in a well of houses he threw himself down in hisclothes on a neglected bed and its pillow was wet with wasted tears  sadly sadly the sun rose it rose upon no sadder sight than theman of good abilities and good emotions incapable of their directedexercise incapable of his own help and his own happiness sensible ofthe blight on him and resigning himself to let it eat him away  vi  hundreds of people  the quiet lodgings of doctor manette were in a quiet streetcornernot far from sohosquare on the afternoon of a certain fine sundaywhen the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treasonand carried it as to the public interest and memory far out tosea mr jarvis lorry walked along the sunny streets fromclerkenwell where he lived on his way to dine with the doctorafter several relapses into businessabsorption mr lorry hadbecome the doctors friend and the quiet streetcorner was thesunny part of his life  on this certain fine sunday mr lorry walked towards soho early inthe afternoon for three reasons of habit firstly because on finesundays he often walked out before dinner with the doctor andlucie secondly because on unfavourable sundays he was accustomedto be with them as the family friend talking reading looking out ofwindow and generally getting through the day thirdly because behappened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve and knew howthe ways of the doctors household pointed to that time as a likelytime for solving them  a quainter corner than the corner where the doctor lived was not tobe found in london there was no way through it and the front windowsof the doctors lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of streetthat had a congenial air of retirement on it there were few buildingsthen north of the oxfordroad and foresttrees flourished andwild flowers grew and the hawthorn blossomed in the now vanishedfields as a consequence country airs circulated in soho withvigorous freedom instead of languishing into the parish like straypaupers without a settlement and there was many a good south wallnot far off on which the peaches ripened in their season  the summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlierpart of the day but when the streets grew hot the corner was inshadow though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyondit into a glare of brightness it was a cool spot staid but cheerfula wonderful place for echoes and a very harbour from the ragingstreets  there ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage andthere was the doctor occupied two floors of a large still housewhere several callings purported to be pursued by day but whereoflittle was audible any day and which was shunned by all of them atnight in a building at the back attainable by a courtyard where aplanetree rustled its green leaves churchorgans claimed to be madeand silver to be chased and likewise gold to be beaten by somemysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall ofthe front hall as if he had beaten himself precious and menaced asimilar conversion of all visitors very little of these trades or ofa lonely lodger rumoured to live upstairs or of a dim coachtrimmingmaker asserted to have a countinghouse below was ever heard or seenoccasionally a stray workman putting his coat on traversed the hallor a stranger peered about there or a distant clink was heardacross the courtyard or a thump from the golden giant thesehowever were only the exceptions required to prove the rule thatthe sparrows in the planetree behind the house and the echoes in thecorner before it had their own way from sunday morning untosaturday night  doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputationand its revival in the floating whispers of his story brought himhis scientific knowledge and his vigilance and skill in conductingingenious experiments brought him otherwise into moderate requestand he earned as much as he wanted  these things were within mr jarvis lorrys knowledge thoughts andnotice when he rang the doorbell of the tranquil house in thecorner on the fine sunday afternoon  doctor manette at home  expected home  miss lucie at home  expected home  miss pross at home  possibly at home but of a certainty impossible for handmaid toanticipate intentions of miss pross as to admission or denial ofthe fact  as i am at home myself said mr lorry ill go upstairs  although the doctors daughter had known nothing of the country ofher birth she appeared to have innately derived from it thatability to make much of little means which is one of its mostuseful and most agreeable characteristics simple as the furniturewas it was set off by so many little adornments of no value butfor their taste and fancy that its effect was delightful thedisposition of everything in the rooms from the largest object to theleast the arrangement of colours the elegant variety and contrastobtained by thrift in trifles by delicate hands clear eyes and goodsense were at once so pleasant in themselves and so expressive oftheir originator that as mr lorry stood looking about him the verychairs and tables seemed to ask him with something of that peculiarexpression which he knew so well by this time whether he approved  there were three rooms on a floor and the doors by which theycommunicated being put open that the air might pass freely throughthem all mr lorry smilingly observant of that fancifulresemblance which he detected all around him walked from one toanother the first was the best room and in it were lucies birdsand flowers and books and desk and worktable and box ofwatercolours the second was the doctors consultingroom usedalso as the diningroom the third changingly speckled by therustle of the planetree in the yard was the doctors bedroom andthere in a corner stood the disused shoemakers bench and tray oftools much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal houseby the wineshop in the suburb of saint antoine in paris  i wonder said mr lorry pausing in his looking about that hekeeps that reminder of his sufferings about him  and why wonder at that was the abrupt inquiry that made himstart  it proceeded from miss pross the wild red woman strong of handwhose acquaintance he had first made at the royal george hotel atdover and had since improved  i should have thought mr lorry began  pooh youd have thought said miss pross and mr lorry left off  how do you do inquired that lady then sharply and yet as ifto express that she bore him no malice  i am pretty well i thank you answered mr lorry withmeekness how are you  nothing to boast of said miss pross  indeed  ah indeed said miss pross i am very much put out about myladybird  indeed  for gracious sake say something else besides indeed or youllfidget me to death said miss pross whose character dissociatedfrom stature was shortness  really then said mr lorry as an amendment  really is bad enough returned miss pross but better yes i amvery much put out  may i ask the cause  i dont want dozens of people who are not at all worthy ofladybird to come here looking after her said miss pross  do dozens come for that purpose  hundreds said miss pross  it was characteristic of this lady as of some other people beforeher time and since that whenever her original proposition wasquestioned she exaggerated it  dear me said mr lorry as the safest remark he could think of  i have lived with the darling or the darling has lived with meand paid me for it which she certainly should never have done youmay take your affidavit if i could have afforded to keep eithermyself or her for nothing since she was ten years old and itsreally very hard said miss pross  not seeing with precision what was very hard mr lorry shook hishead using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloakthat would fit anything  all sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of thepet are always turning up said miss pross when you began it  i began it miss pross  didnt you who brought her father to life  oh if that was beginning it said mr lorry  it wasnt ending it i suppose i say when you began it it washard enough not that i have any fault to find with doctor manetteexcept that he is not worthy of such a daughter which is noimputation on him for it was not to be expected that anybody shouldbe under any circumstances but it really is doubly and trebly hardto have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him icould have forgiven him to take ladybirds affections away from me  mr lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous but he also knew herby this time to be beneath the service of her eccentricity one ofthose unselfish creatures found only among women who will forpure love and admiration bind themselves willing slaves to youthwhen they have lost it to beauty that they never had toaccomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain tobright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives he knewenough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better thanthe faithful service of the heart so rendered and so free from anymercenary taint he had such an exalted respect for it that in theretributive arrangements made by his own mind we all make sucharrangements more or less he stationed miss pross much nearer to thelower angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both bynature and art who had balances at tellsons  there never was nor will be but one man worthy of ladybird saidmiss pross and that was my brother solomon if he hadnt made amistake in life  here again mr lorrys inquiries into miss prosss personal historyhad established the fact that her brother solomon was a heartlessscoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed as a staketo speculate with and had abandoned her in her poverty forevermore with no touch of compunction miss prosss fidelity ofbelief in solomon deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistakewas quite a serious matter with mr lorry and had its weight in hisgood opinion of her  as we happen to be alone for the moment and are both people ofbusiness he said when they had got back to the drawingroom and hadsat down there in friendly relations let me ask you does thedoctor in talking with lucie never refer to the shoemaking timeyet  never  and yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him  ah returned miss pross shaking her head but i dont say hedont refer to it within himself  do you believe that he thinks of it much  i do said miss pross  do you imagine mr lorry had begun when miss pross took himup short with  never imagine anything have no imagination at all  i stand corrected do you suppose you go so far as to supposesometimes  now and then said miss pross  do you suppose mr lorry went on with a laughing twinkle inhis bright eye as it looked kindly at her that doctor manette hasany theory of his own preserved through all those years relativeto the cause of his being so oppressed perhaps even to the name ofhis oppressor  i dont suppose anything about it but what ladybird tells me  and that is  that she thinks he has  now dont be angry at my asking all these questions because i am amere dull man of business and you are a woman of business  dull miss pross inquired with placidity  rather wishing his modest adjective away mr lorry replied nono no surely not to return to business is it not remarkablethat doctor manette unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are anwell assured he is should never touch upon that question i willnot say with me though he had business relations with me many yearsago and we are now intimate i will say with the fair daughter towhom he is so devotedly attached and who is so devotedly attachedto him believe me miss pross i dont approach the topic with youout of curiosity but out of zealous interest  well to the best of my understanding and bads the best youlltell me said miss pross softened by the tone of the apology he isafraid of the whole subject  afraid  its plain enough i should think why he may be its a dreadfulremembrance besides that his loss of himself grew out of it notknowing how he lost himself or how he recovered himself he may neverfeel certain of not losing himself again that alone wouldnt make thesubject pleasant i should think  it was a profounder remark than mr lorry had looked for truesaid he and fearful to reflect upon yet a doubt lurks in mymind miss pross whether it is good for doctor manette to have thatsuppression always shut up within him indeed it is this doubt andthe uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our presentconfidence  cant be helped said miss pross shaking her head touch thatstring and he instantly changes for the worse better leave it alonein short must leave it alone like or no like sometimes he getsup in the dead of the night and will be heard by us overheadthere walking up and down walking up and down in his room ladybirdhas learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and downwalking up and down in his old prison she hurries to him and theygo on together walking up and down walking up and down until heis composed but he never says a word of the true reason of hisrestlessness to her and she finds it best not to hint at it tohim in silence they go walking up and down together walking up anddown together till her love and company have brought him to himself  notwithstanding miss prosss denial of her own imagination therewas a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by onesad idea in her repetition of the phrase walking up and downwhich testified to her possessing such a thing  the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes ithad begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet that itseemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and frohad set it going  here they are said miss pross rising to break up the conferenceand now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon  it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties such apeculiar ear of a place that as mr lorry stood at the open windowlooking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard he fanciedthey would never approach not only would the echoes die away asthough the steps had gone but echoes of other steps that nevercame would be heard in their stead and would die away for good whenthey seemed close at hand however father and daughter did at lastappear and miss pross was ready at the street door to receive them  miss pross was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grimtaking off her darlings bonnet when she came upstairs andtouching it up with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dustoff it and folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothingher rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken inher own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of womenher darling was a pleasant sight too embracing her and thankingher and protesting against her taking so much trouble for herwhich last she only dared to do playfully or miss pross sorely hurtwould have retired to her own chamber and cried the doctor was apleasant sight too looking on at them and telling miss pross how shespoilt lucie in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling inthem as miss pross had and would have had more if it were possiblemr lorry was a pleasant sight too beaming at all this in hislittle wig and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted himin his declining years to a home but no hundreds of people came tosee the sights and mr lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment ofmiss prosss prediction  dinnertime and still no hundreds of people in the arrangements ofthe little household miss pross took charge of the lower regions andalways acquitted herself marvellously her dinners of a very modestquality were so well cooked and so well served and so neat intheir contrivances half english and half french that nothing couldbe better miss prosss friendship being of the thoroughly practicalkind she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces in search ofimpoverished french who tempted by shillings and halfcrownswould impart culinary mysteries to her from these decayed sons anddaughters of gaul she had acquired such wonderful arts that thewoman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quitea sorceress or cinderellas godmother who would send out for a fowla rabbit a vegetable or two from the garden and change them intoanything she pleased  on sundays miss pross dined at the doctors table but on otherdays persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods either in thelower regions or in her own room on the second floor a blue chamberto which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance on thisoccasion miss pross responding to ladybirds pleasant face andpleasant efforts to please her unbent exceedingly so the dinnerwas very pleasant too  it was an oppressive day and after dinner lucie proposed that thewine should be carried out under the planetree and they should sitthere in the air as everything turned upon her and revolved abouther they went out under the planetree and she carried the wine downfor the special benefit of mr lorry she had installed herselfsome time before as mr lorrys cupbearer and while they satunder the planetree talking she kept his glass replenishedmysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked andthe planetree whispered to them in its own way above their heads  still the hundreds of people did not present themselves mr darnaypresented himself while they were sitting under the planetree but hewas only one  doctor manette received him kindly and so did lucie but misspross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and bodyand retired into the house she was not unfrequently the victim ofthis disorder and she called it in familiar conversation a fitof the jerks  the doctor was in his best condition and looked specially youngthe resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such timesand as they sat side by side she leaning on his shoulder and heresting his arm on the back of her chair it was very agreeable totrace the likeness  he had been talking all day on many subjects and with unusualvivacity pray doctor manette said mr darnay as they sat underthe planetree and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topicin hand which happened to be the old buildings of london have youseen much of the tower  lucie and i have been there but only casually we have seen enoughof it to know that it teems with interest little more  i have been there as you remember said darnay with a smilethough reddening a little angrily in another character and not in acharacter that gives facilities for seeing much of it they told mea curious thing when i was there  what was that lucie asked  in making some alterations the workmen came upon an old dungeonwhich had been for many years built up and forgotten every stone ofits inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved byprisoners dates names complaints and prayers upon a cornerstone in an angle of the wall one prisoner who seemed to have goneto execution had cut as his last work three letters they weredone with some very poor instrument and hurriedly with an unsteadyhand at first they were read as d i c but on being morecarefully examined the last letter was found to be g  there was norecord or legend of any prisoner with those initials and manyfruitless guesses were made what the name could have been atlength it was suggested that the letters were not initials but thecomplete word dig the floor was examined very carefully under theinscription and in the earth beneath a stone or tile or somefragment of paving were found the ashes of a paper mingled withthe ashes of a small leathern case or bag what the unknown prisonerhad written will never be read but he had written something andhidden it away to keep it from the gaoler  my father exclaimed lucie you are ill  he had suddenly started up with his hand to his head his mannerand his look quite terrified them all  no my dear not ill there are large drops of rain falling andthey made me start we had better go in  he recovered himself almost instantly rain was really falling inlarge drops and he showed the back of his hand with raindrops on itbut he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that hadbeen told of and as they went into the house the business eye ofmr lorry either detected or fancied it detected on his face as itturned towards charles darnay the same singular look that had beenupon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house  he recovered himself so quickly however that mr lorry haddoubts of his business eye the arm of the golden giant in the hallwas not more steady than he was when he stopped under it to remark tothem that he was not yet proof against slight surprises if he everwould be and that the rain had startled him  teatime and miss pross making tea with another fit of the jerksupon her and yet no hundreds of people mr carton had lounged inbut he made only two  the night was so very sultry that although they sat with doorsand windows open they were overpowered by heat when the teatablewas done with they all moved to one of the windows and looked outinto the heavy twilight lucie sat by her father darnay sat besideher carton leaned against a window the curtains were long and whiteand some of the thundergusts that whirled into the corner caughtthem up to the ceiling and waved them like spectral wings  the raindrops are still falling large heavy and few saiddoctor manette it comes slowly  it comes surely said carton  they spoke low as people watching and waiting mostly do aspeople in a dark room watching and waiting for lightning always do  there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away toget shelter before the storm broke the wonderful corner for echoesresounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going yet not afootstep was there  a multitude of people and yet a solitude said darnay whenthey had listened for a while  is it not impressive mr darnay asked lucie sometimes ihave sat here of an evening until i have fancied but even theshade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder tonight when all is soblack and solemn  let us shudder too we may know what it is  it will seem nothing to you such whims are only impressive as weoriginate them i think they are not to be communicated i havesometimes sat alone here of an evening listening until i have madethe echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are comingbyandbye into our lives  there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives if that beso sydney carton struck in in his moody way  the footsteps were incessant and the hurry of them became moreand more rapid the corner echoed and reechoed with the tread offeet some as it seemed under the windows some as it seemed inthe room some coming some going some breaking off some stoppingaltogether all in the distant streets and not one within sight  are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us missmanette or are we to divide them among us  i dont know mr darnay i told you it was a foolish fancy butyou asked for it when i have yielded myself to it i have been aloneand then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are tocome into my life and my fathers  i take them into mine said carton i ask no questions and makeno stipulations there is a great crowd bearing down upon us missmanette and i see them by the lightning he added the lastwords after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him loungingin the window  and i hear them he added again after a peal of thunder herethey come fast fierce and furious  it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified and it stoppedhim for no voice could be heard in it a memorable storm of thunderand lightning broke with that sweep of water and there was not amoments interval in crash and fire and rain until after the moonrose at midnight  the great bell of saint pauls was striking one in the clearedair when mr lorry escorted by jerry highbooted and bearing alantern set forth on his returnpassage to clerkenwell there weresolitary patches of road on the way between soho and clerkenwelland mr lorry mindful of footpads always retained jerry for thisservice though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier  what a night it has been almost a night jerry said mr lorryto bring the dead out of their graves  i never see the night myself master nor yet i dont expect towhat would do that answered jerry  good night mr carton said the man of business good night mrdarnay shall we ever see such a night again together  perhaps perhaps see the great crowd of people with its rush androar bearing down upon them too  vii  monseigneur in town  monseigneur one of the great lords in power at the court heldhis fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris monseigneur wasin his inner room his sanctuary of sanctuaries the holiest ofholiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms withoutmonseigneur was about to take his chocolate monseigneur could swallowa great many things with ease and was by some few sullen mindssupposed to be rather rapidly swallowing france but his morningschocolate could not so much as get into the throat of monseigneurwithout the aid of four strong men besides the cook  yes it took four men all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration andthe chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watchesin his pocket emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set bymonseigneur to conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneurs lips onelacquey carried the chocolatepot into the sacred presence asecond milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument hebore for that function a third presented the favoured napkin afourth he of the two gold watches poured the chocolate out itwas impossible for monseigneur to dispense with one of theseattendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiringheavens deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if hischocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men he must havedied of two  monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night where thecomedy and the grand opera were charmingly represented monseigneurwas out at a little supper most nights with fascinating company sopolite and so impressible was monseigneur that the comedy and thegrand opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articlesof state affairs and state secrets than the needs of all france ahappy circumstance for france as the like always is for all countriessimilarly favoured always was for england by way of example inthe regretted days of the merry stuart who sold it  monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public businesswhich was to let everything go on in its own way of particularpublic business monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that itmust all go his way tend to his own power and pocket of hispleasures general and particular monseigneur had the other trulynoble idea that the world was made for them the text of his orderaltered from the original by only a pronoun which is not muchran the earth and the fulness thereof are mine saith monseigneur  yet monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments creptinto his affairs both private and public and he had as to bothclasses of affairs allied himself perforce with a farmergeneralas to finances public because monseigneur could not make anythingat all of them and must consequently let them out to somebody whocould as to finances private because farmergenerals were richand monseigneur after generations of great luxury and expense wasgrowing poor hence monseigneur had taken his sister from a conventwhile there was yet time to ward off the impending veil thecheapest garment she could wear and had bestowed her as a prizeupon a very rich farmergeneral poor in family which farmergeneralcarrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it wasnow among the company in the outer rooms much prostrated before bymankind always excepting superior mankind of the blood ofmonseigneur who his own wife included looked down upon him with theloftiest contempt  a sumptuous man was the farmergeneral thirty horses stood in hisstables twentyfour male domestics sat in his halls six bodywomenwaited on his wife as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder andforage where he could the farmergeneral howsoever his matrimonialrelations conduced to social morality was at least the greatestreality among the personages who attended at the hotel ofmonseigneur that day  for the rooms though a beautiful scene to look at and adornedwith every device of decoration that the taste and skin of the timecould achieve were in truth not a sound business considered withany reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhereand not so far off either but that the watching towers of notredame almost equidistant from the two extremes could see themboth they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable businessif that could have been anybodys business at the house ofmonseigneur military officers destitute of military knowledgenaval officers with no idea of a ship civil officers without a notionof affairs brazen ecclesiastics of the worst world worldly withsensual eyes loose tongues and looser lives all totally unfit fortheir several callings all lying horribly in pretending to belong tothem but all nearly or remotely of the order of monseigneur andtherefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was tobe got these were to be told off by the score and the score peoplenot immediately connected with monseigneur or the state yet equallyunconnected with anything that was real or with lives passed intravelling by any straight road to any true earthly end were noless abundant doctors who made great fortunes out of daintyremedies for imaginary disorders that never existed smiled upon theircourtly patients in the antechambers of monseigneur projectors whohad discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with whichthe state was touched except the remedy of setting to work in earnestto root out a single sin poured their distracting babble into anyears they could lay hold of at the reception of monseigneurunbelieving philosophers who were remodelling the world with wordsand making cardtowers of babel to scale the skies with talked withunbelieving chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals atthis wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur exquisitegentlemen of the finest breeding which was at that remarkable timeand has been since to be known by its fruits of indifference to everynatural subject of human interest were in the most exemplary state ofexhaustion at the hotel of monseigneur such homes had thesevarious notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris thatthe spies among the assembled devotees of monseigneur forming agoodly half of the polite company would have found it hard todiscover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife who inher manners and appearance owned to being a mother indeed exceptfor the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this worldwhich does not go far towards the realisation of the name of motherthere was no such thing known to the fashion peasant women kept theunfashionable babies close and brought them up and charminggrandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty  the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature inattendance upon monseigneur in the outermost room were half a dozenexceptional people who had had for a few years some vaguemisgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong as apromising way of setting them right half of the halfdozen had becomemembers of a fantastic sect of convulsionists and were even thenconsidering within themselves whether they should foam rage roarand turn cataleptic on the spot thereby setting up a highlyintelligible fingerpost to the future for monseigneurs guidancebesides these dervishes were other three who had rushed intoanother sect which mended matters with a jargon about the centreof truth holding that man had got out of the centre of truthwhich did not need much demonstration but had not got out of thecircumference and that he was to be kept from flying out of thecircumference and was even to be shoved back into the centre byfasting and seeing of spirits among these accordingly muchdiscoursing with spirits went on and it did a world of good whichnever became manifest  but the comfort was that all the company at the grand hotel ofmonseigneur were perfectly dressed if the day of judgment had onlybeen ascertained to be a dress day everybody there would have beeneternally correct such frizzling and powdering and sticking up ofhair such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mendedsuch gallant swords to look at and such delicate honour to thesense of smell would surely keep anything going for ever and everthe exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendenttrinkets that chinked as they languidly moved these golden fettersrang like precious little bells and what with that ringing andwith the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen there was aflutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and his devouringhunger far away  dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keepingall things in their places everybody was dressed for a fancy ballthat was never to leave off from the palace of the tuileries throughmonseigneur and the whole court through the chambers the tribunalsof justice and all society except the scarecrows the fancy balldescended to the common executioner who in pursuance of the charmwas required to officiate frizzled powdered in a goldlaced coatpumps and white silk stockings at the gallows and the wheelthe axewas a rarity monsieur paris as it was the episcopal mode among hisbrother professors of the provinces monsieur orleans and the restto call him presided in this dainty dress and who among thecompany at monseigneurs reception in that seventeen hundred andeightieth year of our lord could possibly doubt that a system rootedin a frizzled hangman powdered goldlaced pumped and whitesilkstockinged would see the very stars out  monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken hischocolate caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrownopen and issued forth then what submission what cringing andfawning what servility what abject humiliation as to bowing down inbody and spirit nothing in that way was left for heaven which mayhave been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneurnever troubled it  bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there a whisper on onehappy slave and a wave of the hand on another monseigneur affablypassed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumferenceof truth there monseigneur turned and came back again and so indue course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by thechocolate sprites and was seen no more  the show being over the flutter in the air became quite a littlestorm and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs therewas soon but one person left of all the crowd and he with his hatunder his arm and his snuffbox in his hand slowly passed among themirrors on his way out  i devote you said this person stopping at the last door on hisway and turning in the direction of the sanctuary to the devil  with that he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shakenthe dust from his feet and quietly walked downstairs  he was a man of about sixty handsomely dressed haughty inmanner and with a face like a fine mask a face of a transparentpaleness every feature in it clearly defined one set expression onit the nose beautifully formed otherwise was very slightlypinched at the top of each nostril in those two compressions ordints the only little change that the face ever showed resided theypersisted in changing colour sometimes and they would be occasionallydilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation then theygave a look of treachery and cruelty to the whole countenanceexamined with attention its capacity of helping such a look was to befound in the line of the mouth and the lines of the orbits of theeyes being much too horizontal and thin still in the effect ofthe face made it was a handsome face and a remarkable one  its owner went downstairs into the courtyard got into hiscarriage and drove away not many people had talked with him at thereception he had stood in a little space apart and monseigneur mighthave been warmer in his manner it appeared under thecircumstances rather agreeable to him to see the common peopledispersed before his horses and often barely escaping from beingrun down his man drove as if he were charging an enemy and thefurious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face orto the lips of the master the complaint had sometimes made itselfaudible even in that deaf city and dumb age that in the narrowstreets without footways the fierce patrician custom of harddriving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous mannerbut few cared enough for that to think of it a second time and inthis matter as in all others the common wretches were left to getout of their difficulties as they could  with a wild rattle and clatter and an inhuman abandonment ofconsideration not easy to be understood in these days the carriagedashed through streets and swept round corners with women screamingbefore it and men clutching each other and clutching children outof its way at last swooping at a street corner by a fountain one ofits wheels came to a sickening little jolt and there was a loud cryfrom a number of voices and the horses reared and plunged  but for the latter inconvenience the carriage probably would nothave stopped carriages were often known to drive on and leavetheir wounded behind and why not but the frightened valet had gotdown in a hurry and there were twenty hands at the horses bridles  what has gone wrong said monsieur calmly looking out  a tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among thefeet of the horses and had laid it on the basement of the fountainand was down in the mud and wet howling over it like a wild animal  pardon monsieur the marquis said a ragged and submissive manit is a child  why does he make that abominable noise is it his child  excuse me monsieur the marquis it is a pity yes  the fountain was a little removed for the street opened where itwas into a space some ten or twelve yards square as the tall mansuddenly got up from the ground and came running at the carriagemonsieur the marquis clapped his hand for an instant on hisswordhilt  killed shrieked the man in wild desperation extending both armsat their length above his head and staring at him dead  the people closed round and looked at monsieur the marquis therewas nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him butwatchfulness and eagerness there was no visible menacing or angerneither did the people say anything after the first cry they hadbeen silent and they remained so the voice of the submissive man whohad spoken was flat and tame in its extreme submission monsieurthe marquis ran his eyes over them all as if they had been mererats come out of their holes  he took out his purse  it is extraordinary to me said he that you people cannot takecare of yourselves and your children one or the other of you is forever in the way how do i know what injury you have done my horsessee give him that  he threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up and all the headscraned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell thetall man called out again with a most unearthly cry dead  he was arrested by the quick arrival of another man for whom therest made way on seeing him the miserable creature fell upon hisshoulder sobbing and crying and pointing to the fountain where somewomen were stooping over the motionless bundle and moving gentlyabout it they were as silent however as the men  i know all i know all said the last comer be a brave man mygaspard it is better for the poor little plaything to die so than tolive it has died in a moment without pain could it have lived anhour as happily  you are a philosopher you there said the marquis smilinghow do they call you  they call me defarge  of what trade  monsieur the marquis vendor of wine  pick up that philosopher and vendor of wine said the marquisthrowing him another gold coin and spend it as you will thehorses there are they right  without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time monsieurthe marquis leaned back in his seat and was just being driven awaywith the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some commonthing and had paid for it and could afford to pay for it when hisease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage andringing on its floor  hold said monsieur the marquis hold the horses who threwthat  he looked to the spot where defarge the vendor of wine had stooda moment before but the wretched father was grovelling on his face onthe pavement in that spot and the figure that stood beside him wasthe figure of a dark stout woman knitting  you dogs said the marquis but smoothly and with an unchangedfront except as to the spots on his nose i would ride over any ofyou very willingly and exterminate you from the earth if i knewwhich rascal threw at the carriage and if that brigand weresufficiently near it he should be crushed under the wheels  so cowed was their condition and so long and hard theirexperience of what such a man could do to them within the law andbeyond it that not a voice or a hand or even an eye was raisedamong the men not one but the woman who stood knitting looked upsteadily and looked the marquis in the face it was not for hisdignity to notice it his contemptuous eyes passed over her andover all the other rats and he leaned back in his seat again andgave the word go on  he was driven on and other carriages came whirling by in quicksuccession the minister the stateprojector the farmergeneral thedoctor the lawyer the ecclesiastic the grand opera the comedy thewhole fancy ball in a bright continuous flow came whirling by therats had crept out of their holes to look on and they remainedlooking on for hours soldiers and police often passing between themand the spectacle and making a barrier behind which they slunk andthrough which they peeped the father had long ago taken up his bundleand hidden himself away with it when the women who had tended thebundle while it lay on the base of the fountain sat there watchingthe running of the water and the rolling of the fancy ball when theone woman who had stood conspicuous knitting still knitted on withthe steadfastness of fate the water of the fountain ran the swiftriver ran the day ran into evening so much life in the city

wither away  monsieur the marquis in his travelling carriage which might havebeen lighter conducted by four posthorses and two postilionsfagged up a steep hill a blush on the countenance of monsieur themarquis was no impeachment of his high breeding it was not fromwithin it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond hiscontrol the setting sun  the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage whenit gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped in crimsonit will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his handsdirectly  in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when theheavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage sliddown hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glowdeparted quickly the sun and the marquis going down together therewas no glow left when the drag was taken off  but there remained a broken country bold and open a littlevillage at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it achurchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with afortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkeningobjects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air ofone who was coming near home  the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poortannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poorfountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too allpoor a its people were poor and many of them were sitting at theirdoors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many wereat the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such smallyieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of whatmade them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax forthe church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general

prison on the crag  heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of hispostilions whips which twined snakelike about their heads in theevening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur themarquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghousegate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended theiroperations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them withoutknowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face andfigure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an englishsuperstition which should survive the truth through the best part of ahundred years  monsieur the marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces thatdrooped before him as the like of himself had drooped beforemonseigneur of the court only the difference was that these facesdrooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate when a grizzled menderof the roads joined the group  bring me hither that fellow said the marquis to the courier  the fellow was brought cap in hand and the other fellows closedround to look and listen in the manner of the people at the parisfountain  i passed you on the road  monseigneur it is true i had the honour of being passed on theroad  coming up the hill and at the top of the hill both  monseigneur it is true  what did you look at so fixedly  monseigneur i looked at the man  he stooped a little and with his tattered blue cap pointed underthe carriage all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage  what man pig and why look there  pardon monseigneur he swung by the chain of the shoe the drag  who demanded the traveller  monseigneur the man  may the devil carry away these idiots how do you call the man youknow all the men of this part of the country who was he  your clemency monseigneur he was not of this part of the countryof all the days of my life i never saw him  swinging by the chain to be suffocated  with your gracious permission that was the wonder of itmonseigneur his head hanging over like this  he turned himself sideways to the carriage and leaned back withhis face thrown up to the sky and his head hanging down thenrecovered himself fumbled with his cap and made a bow  what was he like  monseigneur he was whiter than the miller all covered withdust white as a spectre tall as a spectre  the picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd butall eyes without comparing notes with other eyes looked atmonsieur the marquis perhaps to observe whether he had any spectreon his conscience  truly you did well said the marquis felicitously sensiblethat such vermin were not to ruffle him to see a thiefaccompanying my carriage and not open that great mouth of yours bahput him aside monsieur gabelle  monsieur gabelle was the postmaster and some other taxingfunctionary united he had come out with great obsequiousness toassist at this examination and had held the examined by the draperyof his arm in an official manner  bah go aside said monsieur gabelle  lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your villagetonight and be sure that his business is honest gabelle  monseigneur i am flattered to devote myself to your orders  did he run away fellow where is that accursed  the accursed was already under the carriage with some halfdozenparticular friends pointing out the chain with his blue cap somehalfdozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out andpresented him breathless to monsieur the marquis  did the man run away dolt when we stopped for the drag  monseigneur he precipitated himself over the hillside headfirst as a person plunges into the river  see to it gabelle go on  the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among thewheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were luckyto save their skins and bones they had very little else to save orthey might not have been so fortunate  the burst with which the carriage started out of the village andup the rise beyond was soon checked by the steepness of the hillgradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upwardamong the many sweet scents of a summer night the postilions witha thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the furiesquietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips the valetwalked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on aheadinto the dim distance  at the steepest point of the hill there was a littleburialground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour onit it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rusticcarver but he had studied the figure from the life his own lifemaybe for it was dreadfully spare and thin  to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long beengrowing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling sheturned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly andpresented herself at the carriagedoor  it is you monseigneur monseigneur a petition  with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable facemonseigneur looked out  how then what is it always petitions  monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband theforester  what of your husband the forester always the same with youpeople he cannot pay something  he has paid all monseigneur he is dead  well he is quiet can i restore him to you  alas no monseigneur but he lies yonder under a little heap ofpoor grass  well  monseigneur there are so many little heaps of poor grass  again well  she looked an old woman but was young her manner was one ofpassionate grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted handstogether with wild energy and laid one of them on thecarriagedoor tenderly caressingly as if it had been a humanbreast and could be expected to feel the appealing touch  monseigneur hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husbanddied of want so many die of want so many more will die of want  again well can i feed them  monseigneur the good god knows but i dont ask it my petitionis that a morsel of stone or wood with my husbands name may beplaced over him to show where he lies otherwise the place will bequickly forgotten it will never be found when i am dead of the samemalady i shall be laid under some other heap of poor grassmonseigneur they are so many they increase so fast there is so muchwant monseigneur monseigneur  the valet had put her away from the door the carriage had brokeninto a brisk trot the postilions had quickened the pace she was leftfar behind and monseigneur again escorted by the furies was rapidlydiminishing the league or two of distance that remained between himand his chateau  the sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him androse as the rain falls impartially on the dusty ragged andtoilworn group at the fountain not far away to whom the mender ofroads with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothingstill enlarged upon his man like a spectre as long as they could bearit by degrees as they could bear no more they dropped off one byone and lights twinkled in little casements which lights as thecasements darkened and more stars came out seemed to have shot upinto the sky instead of having been extinguished  the shadow of a large highroofed house and of many overhangingtrees was upon monsieur the marquis by that time and the shadowwas exchanged for the light of a flambeau as his carriage stoppedand the great door of his chateau was opened to him  monsieur charles whom i expect is he arrived from england  monseigneur not yet  ix  the gorgons head  it was a heavy mass of building that chateau of monsieur themarquis with a large stone courtyard before it and two stonesweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principaldoor a stony business altogether with heavy stone balustrades andstone urns and stone flowers and stone faces of men and stone headsof lions in all directions as if the gorgons head had surveyedit when it was finished two centuries ago  up the broad flight of shallow steps monsieur the marquis flambeaupreceded went from his carriage sufficiently disturbing the darknessto elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the greatpile of stable building away among the trees all else was so quietthat the flambeau carried up the steps and the other flambeau held atthe great door burnt as if they were in a close room of stateinstead of being in the open nightair other sound than the owlsvoice there was none save the falling of a fountain into its stonebasin for it was one of those dark nights that hold their breathby the hour together and then heave a long low sigh and hold theirbreath again  the great door clanged behind him and monsieur the marquiscrossed a hall grim with certain old boarspears swords and knivesof the chase grimmer with certain heavy ridingrods and ridingwhipsof which many a peasant gone to his benefactor death had felt theweight when his lord was angry  avoiding the larger rooms which were dark and made fast for thenight monsieur the marquis with his flambeaubearer going on beforewent up the staircase to a door in a corridor this thrown openadmitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms hisbedchamber and two others high vaulted rooms with cool uncarpetedfloors great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood inwinter time and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in aluxurious age and country the fashion of the last louis but one ofthe line that was never to break the fourteenth louis wasconspicuous in their rich furniture but it was diversified by manyobjects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of france  a suppertable was laid for two in the third of the rooms around room in one of the chateaus four extinguishertopped towers asmall lofty room with its window wide open and the woodenjalousieblinds closed so that the dark night only showed in slighthorizontal lines of black alternating with their broad lines of stonecolour  my nephew said the marquis glancing at the supper preparationthey said he was not arrived  nor was he but he had been expected with monseigneur  ah it is not probable he will arrive tonight nevertheless leavethe table as it is i shall be ready in a quarter of an hour  in a quarter of an hour monseigneur was ready and sat down alone tohis sumptuous and choice supper his chair was opposite to the windowand he had taken his soup and was raising his glass of bordeaux tohis lips when he put it down  what is that he calmly asked looking with attention at thehorizontal lines of black and stone colour  monseigneur that  outside the blinds open the blinds  it was done  well  monseigneur it is nothing the trees and the night are all thatare here  the servant who spoke had thrown the blinds wide had looked outinto the vacant darkness and stood with that blank behind himlooking round for instructions  good said the imperturbable master close them again  that was done too and the marquis went on with his supper he washalf way through it when he again stopped with his glass in his handhearing the sound of wheels it came on briskly and came up to thefront of the chateau  ask who is arrived  it was the nephew of monseigneur he had been some few leaguesbehind monseigneur early in the afternoon he had diminished thedistance rapidly but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur onthe road he had heard of monseigneur at the postinghouses as beingbefore him  he was to be told said monseigneur that supper awaited him thenand there and that he was prayed to come to it in a little whilehe came he had been known in england as charles darnay  monseigneur received him in a courtly manner but they did not shakehands  you left paris yesterday sir he said to monseigneur as hetook his seat at table  yesterday and you  i come direct  from london  yes  you have been a long time coming said the marquis with a smile  on the contrary i come direct  pardon me i mean not a long time on the journey a long timeintending the journey  i have been detained by the nephew stopped a moment in hisanswer various business  without doubt said the polished uncle  so long as a servant was present no other words passed betweenthem when coffee had been served and they were alone together thenephew looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that waslike a fine mask opened a conversation  i have come back sir as you anticipate pursuing the objectthat took me away it carried me into great and unexpected perilbut it is a sacred object and if it had carried me to death i hope itwould have sustained me  not to death said the uncle it is not necessary to say todeath  i doubt sir returned the nephew whether if it had carriedme to the utmost brink of death you would have cared to stop methere  the deepened marks in the nose and the lengthening of the finestraight lines in the cruel face looked ominous as to that the unclemade a graceful gesture of protest which was so clearly a slight formof good breeding that it was not reassuring  indeed sir pursued the nephew for anything i know you mayhave expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to thesuspicious circumstances that surrounded me  no no no said the uncle pleasantly  but however that may be resumed the nephew glancing at him withdeep distrust i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any meansand would know no scruple as to means  my friend i told you so said the uncle with a fine pulsation inthe two marks do me the favour to recall that i told you so longago  i recall it  thank you said the marquis very sweetly indeed  his tone lingered in the air almost like the tone of a musicalinstrument  in effect sir pursued the nephew i believe it to be at onceyour bad fortune and my good fortune that has kept me out of aprison in france here  i do not quite understand returned the uncle sipping his coffeedare i ask you to explain  i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court andhad not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past a letter decachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely  it is possible said the uncle with great calmness for thehonour of the family i could even resolve to incommode you to thatextent pray excuse me  i perceive that happily for me the reception of the day beforeyesterday was as usual a cold one observed the nephew  i would not say happily my friend returned the uncle withrefined politeness i would not be sure of that a good opportunityfor consideration surrounded by the advantages of solitude mightinfluence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influenceit for yourself but it is useless to discuss the question i am asyou say at a disadvantage these little instruments of correctionthese gentle aids to the power and honour of families these slightfavours that might so incommode you are only to be obtained now byinterest and importunity they are sought by so many and they aregranted comparatively to so few it used not to be so but france inall such things is changed for the worse our not remote ancestorsheld the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar fromthis room many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged in thenext room my bedroom one fellow to our knowledge was poniarded onthe spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting hisdaughter his daughter we have lost many privileges a new philosophyhas become the mode and the assertion of our station in thesedays might i do not go so far as to say would but might cause usreal inconvenience all very bad very bad  the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff and shook his headas elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country stillcontaining himself that great means of regeneration  we have so asserted our station both in the old time and in themodern time also said the nephew gloomily that i believe our nameto be more detested than any name in france  let us hope so said the uncle detestation of the high is theinvoluntary homage of the low  there is not pursued the nephew in his former tone a face ican look at in all this country round about us which looks at mewith any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery  a compliment said the marquis to the grandeur of the familymerited by the manner in which the family has sustained itsgrandeur hah and he took another gentle little pinch of snuffand lightly crossed his legs  but when his nephew leaning an elbow on the table covered hiseyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand the fine mask lookedat him sideways with a stronger concentration of keennesscloseness and dislike than was comportable with its wearersassumption of indifference  repression is the only lasting philosophy the dark deference offear and slavery my friend observed the marquis will keep thedogs obedient to the whip as long as this roof looking up to itshuts out the sky  that might not be so long as the marquis supposed if a picture ofthe chateau as it was to be a very few years hence and of fiftylike it as they too were to be a very few years hence could have beenshown to him that night he might have been at a loss to claim his ownfrom the ghastly firecharred plunderwrecked ruins as for the roofhe vaunted he might have found that shutting out the sky in a newway to wit for ever from the eyes of the bodies into which its leadwas fired out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets  meanwhile said the marquis i will preserve the honour andrepose of the family if you will not but you must be fatigued shallwe terminate our conference for the night  a moment more  an hour if you please  sir said the nephew we have done wrong and are reaping thefruits of wrong  we have done wrong repeated the marquis with an inquiring smileand delicately pointing first to his nephew then to himself  our family our honourable family whose honour is of so muchaccount to both of us in such different ways even in my fatherstime we did a world of wrong injuring every human creature whocame between us and our pleasure whatever it was why need i speak ofmy fathers time when it is equally yours can i separate my fatherstwinbrother joint inheritor and next successor from himself  death has done that said the marquis  and has left me answered the nephew bound to a system that isfrightful to me responsible for it but powerless in it seeking toexecute the last request of my dear mothers lips and obey the lastlook of my dear mothers eyes which implored me to have mercy andto redress and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain  seeking them from me my nephew said the marquis touching him onthe breast with his forefinger they were now standing by thehearth you will for ever seek them in vain be assured  every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face wascruelly craftily and closely compressed while he stood lookingquietly at his nephew with his snuffbox in his hand once again hetouched him on the breast as though his finger were the fine point ofa small sword with which in delicate finesse he ran him through thebody and said  my friend i will die perpetuating the system under which i havelived  when he had said it he took a culminating pinch of snuff and puthis box in his pocket  better to be a rational creature he added then after ringing asmall bell on the table and accept your natural destiny but you arelost monsieur charles i see  this property and france are lost to me said the nephew sadlyi renounce them  are they both yours to renounce france may be but is theproperty it is scarcely worth mentioning but is it yet  i had no intention in the words i used to claim it yet if itpassed to me from you tomorrow  which i have the vanity to hope is not probable  or twenty years hence  you do me too much honour said the marquis still i prefer thatsupposition  i would abandon it and live otherwise and elsewhere it is littleto relinquish what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin  hah said the marquis glancing round the luxurious room  to the eye it is fair enough here but seen in its integrityunder the sky and by the daylight it is a crumbling tower ofwaste mismanagement extortion debt mortgage oppression hungernakedness and suffering  hah said the marquis again in a wellsatisfied manner  if it ever becomes mine it shall be put into some hands betterqualified to free it slowly if such a thing is possible from theweight that drags it down so that the miserable people who cannotleave it and who have been long wrung to the last point ofendurance may in another generation suffer less but it is notfor me there is a curse on it and on all this land  and you said the uncle forgive my curiosity do you under yournew philosophy graciously intend to live  i must do to live what others of my countrymen even withnobility at their backs may have to do some day work  in england for example  yes the family honour sir is safe from me in this country thefamily name can suffer from me in no other for i bear it in noother  the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bedchamber to belighted it now shone brightly through the door of communication themarquis looked that way and listened for the retreating step of hisvalet  england is very attractive to you seeing how indifferently youhave prospered there he observed then turning his calm face tohis nephew with a smile  i have already said that for my prospering there i am sensiblei may be indebted to you sir for the rest it is my refuge  they say those boastful english that it is the refuge of manyyou know a compatriot who has found a refuge there a doctor  yes  with a daughter  yes  yes said the marquis you are fatigued good night  as he bent his head in his most courtly manner there was asecrecy in his smiling face and he conveyed an air of mystery tothose words which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly atthe same time the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes andthe thin straight lips and the markings in the nose curved with asarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic  yes repeated the marquis a doctor with a daughter yes socommences the new philosophy you are fatigued good night  it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone faceoutside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his the nephewlooked at him in vain in passing on to the door  good night said the uncle i look to the pleasure of seeingyou again in the morning good repose light monsieur my nephew to hischamber there and burn monsieur my nephew in his bed if youwill he added to himself before he rang his little bell againand summoned his valet to his own bedroom  the valet come and gone monsieur the marquis walked to and fro inhis loose chamberrobe to prepare himself gently for sleep thathot still night rustling about the room his softlyslippered feetmaking no noise on the floor he moved like a refined tiger lookedlike some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort in storywhose periodical change into tiger form was either just going offor just coming on  he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom looking again atthe scraps of the days journey that came unbidden into his mindthe slow toil up the hill at sunset the setting sun the descent themill the prison on the crag the little village in the hollow thepeasants at the fountain and the mender of roads with his blue cappointing out the chain under the carriage that fountain suggested theparis fountain the little bundle lying on the step the women bendingover it and the tall man with his arms up crying dead  i am cool now said monsieur the marquis and may go to bed  so leaving only one light burning on the large hearth he let histhin gauze curtains fall around him and heard the night break itssilence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep  the stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black nightfor three heavy hours for three heavy hours the horses in thestables rattled at their racks the dogs barked and the owl made anoise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionallyassigned to the owl by menpoets but it is the obstinate custom ofsuch creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them  for three heavy hours the stone faces of the chateau lion andhuman stared blindly at the night dead darkness lay on all thelandscape dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on allthe roads the burialplace had got to the pass that its littleheaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another thefigure on the cross might have come down for anything that could beseen of it in the village taxers and taxed were fast asleepdreaming perhaps of banquets as the starved usually do and of easeand rest as the driven slave and the yoked ox may its leaninhabitants slept soundly and were fed and freed  the fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard and thefountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard both melting awaylike the minutes that were falling from the spring of time throughthree dark hours then the grey water of both began to be ghostlyin the light and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau wereopened  lighter and lighter until at last the sun touched the tops of thestill trees and poured its radiance over the hill in the glow thewater of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood and the stonefaces crimsoned the carol of the birds was loud and high and on theweatherbeaten sill of the great window of the bedchamber of monsieurthe marquis one little bird sang its sweetest song with all itsmight at this the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed andwith open mouth and dropped underjaw looked awestricken  now the sun was full up and movement began in the villagecasement windows opened crazy doors were unbarred and people cameforth shivering chilled as yet by the new sweet air then began therarely lightened toil of the day among the village population someto the fountain some to the fields men and women here to dig anddelve men and women there to see to the poor live stock and leadthe bony cows out to such pasture as could be found by theroadside in the church and at the cross a kneeling figure or twoattendant on the latter prayers the led cow trying for a breakfastamong the weeds at its foot  the chateau awoke later as became its quality but awokegradually and surely first the lonely boarspears and knives ofthe chase had been reddened as of old then had gleamed trenchantin the morning sunshine now doors and windows were thrown openhorses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the lightand freshness pouring in at doorways leaves sparkled and rustled atirongrated windows dogs pulled hard at their chains and rearedimpatient to be loosed  all these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life and thereturn of morning surely not so the ringing of the great bell of thechateau nor the running up and down the stairs nor the hurriedfigures on the terrace nor the booting and tramping here and thereand everywhere nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away  what winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roadsalready at work on the hilltop beyond the village with his daysdinner not much to carry lying in a bundle that it was worth nocrows while to peck at on a heap of stones had the birdscarrying some grains of it to a distance dropped one over him as theysow chance seeds whether or no the mender of roads ran on thesultry morning as if for his life down the hill kneehigh indust and never stopped till he got to the fountain  all the people of the village were at the fountain standing aboutin their depressed manner and whispering low but showing no otheremotions than grim curiosity and surprise the led cows hastilybrought in and tethered to anything that would hold them were lookingstupidly on or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularlyrepaying their trouble which they had picked up in theirinterrupted saunter some of the people of the chateau and some ofthose of the postinghouse and all the taxing authorities were armedmore or less and were crowded on the other side of the littlestreet in a purposeless way that was highly fraught with nothingalready the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of agroup of fifty particular friends and was smiting himself in thebreast with his blue cap what did all this portend and whatportended the swift hoistingup of monsieur gabelle behind a servanton horseback and the conveying away of the said gabelle doubleladenthough the horse was at a gallop like a new version of the germanballad of leonora  it portended that there was one stone face too many up at thechateau  the gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night and hadadded the one stone face wanting the stone face for which it hadwaited through about two hundred years  it lay back on the pillow of monsieur the marquis it was like afine mask suddenly startled made angry and petrified driven homeinto the heart of the stone figure attached to it was a kniferound its hilt was a frill of paper on which was scrawled  drive him fast to his tomb this from jacques  x  two promises  more months to the number of twelve had come and gone and mrcharles darnay was established in england as a higher teacher of thefrench language who was conversant with french literature in thisage he would have been a professor in that age he was a tutor heread with young men who could find any leisure and interest for thestudy of a living tongue spoken all over the world and hecultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy he couldwrite of them besides in sound english and render them into soundenglish such masters were not at that time easily found princes thathad been and kings that were to be were not yet of the teacherclass and no ruined nobility had dropped out of tellsons ledgers toturn cooks and carpenters as a tutor whose attainments made thestudents way unusually pleasant and profitable and as an eleganttranslator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionaryknowledge young mr darnay soon became known and encouraged he waswell acquainted moreover with the circumstances of his countryand those were of evergrowing interest so with great perseveranceand untiring industry he prospered  in london he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold norto lie on beds of roses if he had had any such exalted expectationhe would not have prospered he had expected labour and he foundit and did it and made the best of it in this his prosperityconsisted  a certain portion of his time was passed at cambridge where he readwith undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove acontraband trade in european languages instead of conveying greek andlatin through the customhouse the rest of his time he passed inlondon  now from the days when it was always summer in eden to thesedays when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes the world of aman has invariably gone one way charles darnays way the way ofthe love of a woman  he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger he had neverheard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionatevoice he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful as hers when itwas confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dugfor him but he had not yet spoken to her on the subject theassassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heavingwater and the long long dusty roads the solid stone chateau whichhad itself become the mere mist of a dream had been done a yearand he had never yet by so much as a single spoken word disclosed toher the state of his heart  that he had his reasons for this he knew full well it was againa summer day when lately arrived in london from his collegeoccupation he turned into the quiet corner in soho bent on seekingan opportunity of opening his mind to doctor manette it was the closeof the summer day and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross  he found the doctor reading in his armchair at a window the energywhich had at once supported him under his old sufferings andaggravated their sharpness had been gradually restored to him he wasnow a very energetic man indeed with great firmness of purposestrength of resolution and vigour of action in his recoveredenergy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden as he had at firstbeen in the exercise of his other recovered faculties but this hadnever been frequently observable and had grown more and more rare  he studied much slept little sustained a great deal of fatiguewith ease and was equably cheerful to him now entered charlesdarnay at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand  charles darnay i rejoice to see you we have been counting on yourreturn these three or four days past mr stryver and sydney cartonwere both here yesterday and both made you out to be more than due  i am obliged to them for their interest in the matter heanswered a little coldly as to them though very warmly as to thedoctor miss manette  is well said the doctor as he stopped short and your returnwill delight us all she has gone out on some household matters butwill soon be home  doctor manette i knew she was from home i took the opportunity ofher being from home to beg to speak to you  there was a blank silence  yes said the doctor with evident constraint bring your chairhere and speak on  he complied as to the chair but appeared to find the speaking onless easy  i have had the happiness doctor manette of being so intimatehere so he at length began for some year and a half that i hopethe topic on which i am about to touch may not  he was stayed by the doctors putting out his hand to stop him whenhe had kept it so a little while he said drawing it back  is lucie the topic  she is  it is hard for me to speak of her at any time it is very hardfor me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours charles darnay  it is a tone of fervent admiration true homage and deep lovedoctor manette he said deferentially  there was another blank silence before her father rejoined  i believe it i do you justice i believe it  his constraint was so manifest and it was so manifest too that itoriginated in an unwillingness to approach the subject that charlesdarnay hesitated  shall i go on sir  another blank  yes go on  you anticipate what i would say though you cannot know howearnestly i say it how earnestly i feel it without knowing my secretheart and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has longbeen laden dear doctor manette i love your daughter fondlydearly disinterestedly devotedly if ever there were love in theworld i love her you have loved yourself let your old love speakfor me  the doctor sat with his face turned away and his eyes bent on theground at the last words he stretched out his hand again hurriedlyand cried  not that sir let that be i adjure you do not recall that  his cry was so like a cry of actual pain that it rang in charlesdarnays ears long after he had ceased he motioned with the hand hehad extended and it seemed to be an appeal to darnay to pause thelatter so received it and remained silent  i ask your pardon said the doctor in a subdued tone aftersome moments i do not doubt your loving lucie you may besatisfied of it  he turned towards him in his chair but did not look at him orraise his eyes his chin dropped upon his hand and his white hairovershadowed his face  have you spoken to lucie  no  nor written  never  it would be ungenerous to affect not to know that yourselfdenial is to be referred to your consideration for her fatherher father thanks you  he offered his hand but his eyes did not go with it  i know said darnay respectfully how can i fail to know doctormanette i who have seen you together from day to day that betweenyou and miss manette there is an affection so unusual so touching sobelonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured thatit can have few parallels even in the tenderness between a father andchild i know doctor manette how can i fail to know that mingledwith the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a womanthere is in her heart towards you all the love and reliance ofinfancy itself i know that as in her childhood she had no parent soshe is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of herpresent years and character united to the trustfulness and attachmentof the early days in which you were lost to her i know perfectly wellthat if you had been restored to her from the world beyond thislife you could hardly be invested in her sight with a more sacredcharacter than that in which you are always with her i know that whenshe is clinging to you the hands of baby girl and woman all inone are round your neck i know that in loving you she sees and lovesher mother at her own age sees and loves you at my age loves hermother brokenhearted loves you through your dreadful trial and inyour blessed restoration i have known this night and day since ihave known you in your home  her father sat silent with his face bent down his breathing wasa little quickened but he repressed all other signs of agitation  dear doctor manette always knowing this always seeing her and youwith this hallowed light about you i have forborne and forborneas long as it was in the nature of man to do it i have felt and doeven now feel that to bring my love even mine between you is totouch your history with something not quite so good as itself but ilove her heaven is my witness that i love her  i believe it answered her father mournfully i have thoughtso before now i believe it  but do not believe said darnay upon whose ear the mournfulvoice struck with a reproachful sound that if my fortune were socast as that being one day so happy as to make her my wife i must atany time put any separation between her and you i could or wouldbreathe a word of what i now say besides that i should know it tobe hopeless i should know it to be a baseness if i had any suchpossibility even at a remote distance of years harboured in mythoughts and hidden in my heart if it ever had been there if itever could be there i could not now touch this honoured hand  he laid his own upon it as he spoke  no dear doctor manette like you a voluntary exile from francelike you driven from it by its distractions oppressions andmiseries like you striving to live away from it by my own exertionsand trusting in a happier future i look only to sharing yourfortunes sharing your life and home and being faithful to you to thedeath not to divide with lucie her privilege as your childcompanion and friend but to come in aid of it and bind her closerto you if such a thing can be  his touch still lingered on her fathers hand answering the touchfor a moment but not coldly her father rested his hands upon thearms of his chair and looked up for the first time since thebeginning of the conference a struggle was evidently in his face astruggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it todark doubt and dread  you speak so feelingly and so manfully charles darnay that ithank you with all my heart and will open all my heart or nearly sohave you any reason to believe that lucie loves you  none as yet none  is it the immediate object of this confidence that you may at onceascertain that with my knowledge  not even so i might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks imight mistaken or not mistaken have that hopefulness tomorrow  do you seek any guidance from me  i ask none sir but i have thought it possible that you might haveit in your power if you should deem it right to give me some  do you seek any promise from me  i do seek that  what is it  i well understand that without you i could have no hope i wellunderstand that even if miss manette held me at this moment in herinnocent heart do not think i have the presumption to assume so muchi could retain no place in it against her love for her father  if that be so do you see what on the other hand is involved init  i understand equally well that a word from her father in anysuitors favour would outweigh herself and all the world for whichreason doctor manette said darnay modestly but firmly i wouldnot ask that word to save my life  i am sure of it charles darnay mysteries arise out of close loveas well as out of wide division in the former case they are subtleand delicate and difficult to penetrate my daughter lucie is inthis one respect such a mystery to me i can make no guess at thestate of her heart  may i ask sir if you think she is as he hesitated herfather supplied the rest  is sought by any other suitor  it is what i meant to say  her father considered a little before he answered  you have seen mr carton here yourself mr stryver is here toooccasionally if it be at all it can only be by one of these  or both said darnay  i had not thought of both i should not think either likely youwant a promise from me tell me what it is  it is that if miss manette should bring to you at any time on herown part such a confidence as i have ventured to lay before youyou will bear testimony to what i have said and to your belief in iti hope you may be able to think so well of me as to urge no influenceagainst me i say nothing more of my stake in this this is what iask the condition on which i ask it and which you have anundoubted right to require i will observe immediately  i give the promise said the doctor without any condition ibelieve your object to be purely and truthfully as you have statedit i believe your intention is to perpetuate and not to weakenthe ties between me and my other and far dearer self if she shouldever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness i willgive her to you if there were charles darnay if there were  the young man had taken his hand gratefully their bands were joinedas the doctor spoke  any fancies any reasons any apprehensions anythingwhatsoever new or old against the man she really loved the directresponsibility thereof not lying on his head they should all beobliterated for her sake she is everything to me more to me thansuffering more to me than wrong more to me well this is idletalk  so strange was the way in which he faded into silence and sostrange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak that darnay felthis own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and droppedit  you said something to me said doctor manette breaking into asmile what was it you said to me  he was at a loss how to answer until he remembered having spoken ofa condition relieved as his mind reverted to that he answered  your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidenceon my part my present name though but slightly changed from mymothers is not as you will remember my own i wish to tell youwhat that is and why i am in england  stop said the doctor of beauvais  i wish it that i may the better deserve your confidence andhave no secret from you  stop  for an instant the doctor even had his two hands at his ears foranother instant even had his two hands laid on darnays lips  tell me when i ask you not now if your suit should prosper iflucie should love you you shall tell me on your marriage morningdo you promise  willingly  give me your hand she will be home directly and it is bettershe should not see us together tonight go god bless you  it was dark when charles darnay left him and it was an hour laterand darker when lucie came home she hurried into the room alonefor miss pross had gone straight upstairs and was surprised tofind his readingchair empty  my father she called to him father dear  nothing was said in answer but she heard a low hammering sound inhis bedroom passing lightly across the intermediate room shelooked in at his door and came running back frightened crying toherself with her blood all chilled what shall i do what shall ido  her uncertainty lasted but a moment she hurried back and tapped athis door and softly called to him the noise ceased at the sound ofher voice and he presently came out to her and they walked up anddown together for a long time  she came down from her bed to look at him in his sleep thatnight he slept heavily and his tray of shoemaking tools and his oldunfinished work were all as usual  xi  a companion picture  sydney said mr stryver on that selfsame night or morning tohis jackal mix another bowl of punch i have something to say toyou  sydney had been working double tides that night and the nightbefore and the night before that and a good many nights insuccession making a grand clearance among mr stryvers papers beforethe setting in of the long vacation the clearance was effected atlast the stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up everything wasgot rid of until november should come with its fogs atmospheric andfogs legal and bring grist to the mill again  sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so muchapplication it had taken a deal of extra wettowelling to pull himthrough the night a correspondingly extra quantity of wine hadpreceded the towelling and he was in a very damaged condition ashe now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which hehad steeped it at intervals for the last six hours  are you mixing that other bowl of punch said stryver theportly with his hands in his waistband glancing round from thesofa where he lay on his back  i am  now look here i am going to tell you something that will rathersurprise you and that perhaps will make you think me not quite asshrewd as you usually do think me i intend to marry  do you  yes and not for money what do you say now  i dont feel disposed to say much who is she  guess  do i know her  guess  i am not going to guess at five oclock in the morning with mybrains frying and sputtering in my head if you want me to guessyou must ask me to dinner  well then ill tell you said stryver coming slowly into asitting posture sydney i rather despair of making myselfintelligible to you because you are such an insensible dog  and you returned sydney busy concocting the punch are such asensitive and poetical spirit  come rejoined stryver laughing boastfully though i dontprefer any claim to being the soul of romance for i hope i knowbetter still i am a tenderer sort of fellow than you  you are a luckier if you mean that  i dont mean that i mean i am a man of more more  say gallantry while you are about it suggested carton  well ill say gallantry my meaning is that i am a man saidstryver inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch whocares more to be agreeable who takes more pains to be agreeablewho knows better how to be agreeable in a womans society than youdo  go on said sydney carton  no but before i go on said stryver shaking his head in hisbullying way ill have this out with you youve been at doctormanettes house as much as i have or more than i have why i havebeen ashamed of your moroseness there your manners have been ofthat silent and sullen and hangdog kind that upon my life andsoul i have been ashamed of you sydney  it should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at thebar to be ashamed of anything returned sydney you ought to bemuch obliged to me  you shall not get off in that way rejoined stryver shoulderingthe rejoinder at him no sydney its my duty to tell you and itell you to your face to do you goodthat you are a devilishillconditioned fellow in that sort of society you are a disagreeablefellow  sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made and laughed  look at me said stryver squaring himself i have less need tomake myself agreeable than you have being more independent incircumstances why do i do it  i never saw you do it yet muttered carton  i do it because its politic i do it on principle and look at mei get on  you dont get on with your account of your matrimonial intentionsanswered carton with a careless air i wish you would keep tothat as to me will you never understand that i am incorrigible  he asked the question with some appearance of scorn  you have no business to be incorrigible was his friendsanswer delivered in no very soothing tone  i have no business to be at all that i know of said sydneycarton who is the lady  now dont let my announcement of the name make youuncomfortable sydney said mr stryver preparing him withostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to makebecause i know you dont mean half you say and if you meant itall it would be of no importance i make this little preface becauseyou once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms  i did  certainly and in these chambers  sydney carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacentfriend drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend  you made mention of the young lady as a goldenhaired doll theyoung lady is miss manette if you had been a fellow of anysensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way sydney imight have been a little resentful of your employing such adesignation but you are not you want that sense altogethertherefore i am no more annoyed when i think of the expression thani should be annoyed by a mans opinion of a picture of mine who hadno eye for pictures or of a piece of music of mine who had no earfor music  sydney carton drank the punch at a great rate drank it bybumpers looking at his friend  now you know all about it syd said mr stryver i dont careabout fortune she is a charming creature and i have made up mymind to please myself on the whole i think i can afford to pleasemyself she will have in me a man already pretty well off and arapidly rising man and a man of some distinction it is a piece ofgood fortune for her but she is worthy of good fortune are youastonished  carton still drinking the punch rejoined why should i beastonished  you approve  carton still drinking the punch rejoined why should i notapprove  well said his friend stryver you take it more easily than ifancied you would and are less mercenary on my behalf than ithought you would be though to be sure you know well enough by thistime that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will yessydney i have had enough of this style of life with no other as achange from it i feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have ahome when he feels inclined to go to it when he doesnt he canstay away and i feel that miss manette will tell well in anystation and will always do me credit so i have made up my mindand now sydney old boy i want to say a word to you about yourprospects you are in a bad way you know you really are in a badway you dont know the value of money you live hard youll knock upone of these days and be ill and poor you really ought to thinkabout a nurse  the prosperous patronage with which he said it made him looktwice as big as he was and four times as offensive  now let me recommend you pursued stryver to look it in theface i have looked it in the face in my different way look it inthe face you in your different way marry provide somebody totake care of you never mind your having no enjoyment of womenssociety nor understanding of it nor tact for it find outsomebody find out some respectable woman with a little propertysomebody in the landlady way or lodgingletting way and marry heragainst a rainy day thats the kind of thing for you now think ofit sydney  ill think of it said sydney  xii  the fellow of delicacy  mr stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowalof good fortune on the doctors daughter resolved to make herhappiness known to her before he left town for the long vacationafter some mental debating of the point he came to the conclusionthat it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with andthey could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give herhis hand a week or two before michaelmas term or in the littlechristmas vacation between it and hilary  as to the strength of his case he had not a doubt about it butclearly saw his way to the verdict argued with the jury onsubstantial worldly grounds the only grounds ever worth taking intoaccountit was a plain case and had not a weak spot in it hecalled himself for the plaintiff there was no getting over hisevidence the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief and thejury did not even turn to consider after trying it stryver c jwas satisfied that no plainer case could be  accordingly mr stryver inaugurated the long vacation with a formalproposal to take miss manette to vauxhall gardens that failing toranelagh that unaccountably failing too it beloved him to presenthimself in soho and there declare his noble mind  towards soho therefore mr stryver shouldered his way from thetemple while the bloom of the long vacations infancy was stillupon it anybody who had seen him projecting himself into soho whilehe was yet on saint dunstans side of temple bar bursting in hisfullblown way along the pavement to the jostlement of all weakerpeople might have seen how safe and strong he was  his way taking him past tellsons and he both banking attellsons and knowing mr lorry as the intimate friend of themanettes it entered mr stryvers mind to enter the bank andreveal to mr lorry the brightness of the soho horizon so bepushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat stumbled downthe two steps got past the two ancient cashiers and shoulderedhimself into the musty back closet where mr lorry sat at greatbooks ruled for figures with perpendicular iron bars to his window asif that were ruled for figures too and everything under the cloudswere a sum  halloa said mr stryver how do you do i hope you are well  it was stryvers grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big forany place or space he was so much too big for tellsons that oldclerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance asthough he squeezed them against the wall the house itselfmagnificently reading the paper quite in the faroff perspectivelowered displeased as if the stryver head had been butted into itsresponsible waistcoat  the discreet mr lorry said in a sample tone of the voice hewould recommend under the circumstances how do you do mrstryver how do you do sir and shook hands there was a peculiarityin his manner of shaking hands always to be seen in any clerk attellsons who shook hands with a customer when the house pervadedthe air he shook in a selfabnegating way as one who shook fortellson and co  can i do anything for you mr stryver asked mr lorry in hisbusiness character  why no thank you this is a private visit to yourself mr lorryi have come for a private word  oh indeed said mr lorry bending down his ear while his eyestrayed to the house afar off  i am going said mr stryver leaning his arms confidentially onthe desk whereupon although it was a large double one thereappeared to be not half desk enough for him i am going to make anoffer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend missmanette mr lorry  oh dear me cried mr lorry rubbing his chin and looking athis visitor dubiously  oh dear me sir repeated stryver drawing back oh dear yousir what may your meaning be mr lorry  my meaning answered the man of business is of course friendlyand appreciative and that it does you the greatest credit and inshort my meaning is everything you could desire but really youknow mr stryver mr lorry paused and shook his head at him inthe oddest manner as if he were compelled against his will to addinternally you know there really is so much too much of you  well said stryver slapping the desk with his contentious handopening his eyes wider and taking a long breath if i understandyou mr lorry ill be hanged  mr lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towardsthat end and bit the feather of a pen  dn it all sir said stryver staring at him am i noteligible  oh dear yes yes oh yes youre eligible said mr lorry if yousay eligible you are eligible  am i not prosperous asked stryver  oh if you come to prosperous you are prosperous said mr lorry  and advancing  if you come to advancing you know said mr lorry delighted to beable to make another admission nobody can doubt that  then what on earth is your meaning mr lorry demanded stryverperceptibly crestfallen  well i were you going there now asked mr lorry  straight said stryver with a plump of his fist on the desk  then i think i wouldnt if i was you  why said stryver now ill put you in a corner forensicallyshaking a forefinger at him you are a man of business and bound tohave a reason state your reason why wouldnt you go  because said mr lorry i wouldnt go on such an objectwithout having some cause to believe that i should succeed  dn me cried stryver but this beats everything  mr lorry glanced at the distant house and glanced at the angrystryver  heres a man of business a man of years a man of experience in abank said stryver and having summed up three leading reasons forcomplete success he says theres no reason at all says it with hishead on mr stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it wouldhave been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his headoff  when i speak of success i speak of success with the young ladyand when i speak of causes and reasons to make success probable ispeak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the younglady the young lady my good sir said mr lorry mildly tapping thestryver arm the young lady the young lady goes before all  then you mean to tell me mr lorry said stryver squaring hiselbows that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady atpresent in question is a mincing fool  not exactly so i mean to tell you mr stryver said mr lorryreddening that i will hear no disrespectful word of that younglady from any lips and that if i knew any man which i hope i do notwhose taste was so coarse and whose temper was so overbearing thathe could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of thatyoung lady at this desk not even tellsons should prevent my givinghim a piece of my mind  the necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put mrstryvers bloodvessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn tobe angry mr lorrys veins methodical as their courses could usuallybe were in no better state now it was his turn  that is what i mean to tell you sir said mr lorry pray letthere be no mistake about it  mr stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while and thenstood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it which probably gave himthe toothache he broke the awkward silence by saying  this is something new to me mr lorry you deliberately adviseme not to go up to soho and offer myself myself stryver of thekings bench bar  do you ask me for my advice mr stryver  yes i do  very good then i give it and you have repeated it correctly  and all i can say of it is laughed stryver with a vexed laughthat this ha ha beats everything past present and to come  now understand me pursued mr lorry as a man of business iam not justified in saying anything about this matter for as a manof business i know nothing of it but as an old fellow who hascarried miss manette in his arms who is the trusted friend of missmanette and of her father too and who has a great affection forthem both i have spoken the confidence is not of my seekingrecollect now you think i may not be right  not i said stryver whistling i cant undertake to find thirdparties in common sense i can only find it for myself i supposesense in certain quarters you suppose mincing breadandbutternonsense its new to me but you are right i dare say  what i suppose mr stryver i claim to characterise for myselfand understand me sir said mr lorry quickly flushing again iwill not not even at tellsons have it characterised for me by anygentleman breathing  there i beg your pardon said stryver  granted thank you well mr stryver i was about to say itmight be painful to you to find yourself mistaken it might be painfulto doctor manette to have the task of being explicit with you itmight be very painful to miss manette to have the task of beingexplicit with you you know the terms upon which i have the honour andhappiness to stand with the family if you please committing you inno way representing you in no way i will undertake to correct myadvice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgmentexpressly brought to bear upon it if you should then bedissatisfied with it you can but test its soundness for yourself ifon the other hand you should be satisfied with it and it should bewhat it now is it may spare all sides what is best spared what doyou say  how long would you keep me in town  oh it is only a question of a few hours i could go to soho in theevening and come to your chambers afterwards  then i say yes said stryver i wont go up there now i am notso hot upon it as that comes to i say yes and i shall expect youto look in tonight good morning  then mr stryver turned and burst out of the bank causing such aconcussion of air on his passage through that to stand up againstit bowing behind the two counters required the utmost remainingstrength of the two ancient clerks those venerable and feeble personswere always seen by the public in the act of bowing and werepopularly believed when they had bowed a customer out still tokeep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customerin  the barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would nothave gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid groundthan moral certainty unprepared as he was for the large pill he hadto swallow he got it down and now said mr stryver shaking hisforensic forefinger at the temple in general when it was down myway out of this is to put you all in the wrong  it was a bit of the art of an old bailey tactician in which befound great relief you shall not put me in the wrong young ladysaid mr stryver ill do that for you  accordingly when mr lorry called that night as late as tenoclock mr stryver among a quantity of books and papers litteredout for the purpose seemed to have nothing less on his mind thanthe subject of the morning he even showed surprise when he saw mrlorry and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state  well said that goodnatured emissary after a full halfhour ofbootless attempts to bring him round to the question i have beento soho  to soho repeated mr stryver coldly oh to be sure what ami thinking of  and i have no doubt said mr lorry that i was right in theconversation we had my opinion is confirmed and i reiterate myadvice  i assure you returned mr stryver in the friendliest waythat i am sorry for it on your account and sorry for it on thepoor fathers account i know this must always be a sore subjectwith the family let us say no more about it  i dont understand you said mr lorry  i dare say not rejoined stryver nodding his head in asmoothing and final way no matter no matter  but it does matter mr lorry urged  no it doesnt i assure you it doesnt having supposed thatthere was sense where there is no sense and a laudable ambition wherethere is not a laudable ambition i am well out of my mistake andno harm is done young women have committed similar follies oftenbefore and have repented them in poverty and obscurity oftenbefore in an unselfish aspect i am sorry that the thing isdropped because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldlypoint of view in a selfish aspect i am glad that the thing hasdropped because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldlypoint of view it is hardly necessary to say i could have gainednothing by it there is no harm at all done i have not proposed tothe young lady and between ourselves i am by no means certain onreflection that i ever should have committed myself to that extentmr lorry you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinessesof emptyheaded girls you must not expect to do it or you willalways be disappointed now pray say no more about it i tell youi regret it on account of others but i am satisfied on my ownaccount and i am really very much obliged to you for allowing me tosound you and for giving me your advice you know the young ladybetter than i do you were right it never would have done  mr lorry was so taken aback that he looked quite stupidly at mrstryver shouldering him towards the door with an appearance ofshowering generosity forbearance and goodwill on his erring headmake the best of it my dear sir said stryver say no more aboutit thank you again for allowing me to sound you good night  mr lorry was out in the night before he knew where he was mrstryver was lying back on his sofa winking at his ceiling  xiii  the fellow of no delicacy  if sydney carton ever shone anywhere he certainly never shone inthe house of doctor manette he had been there often during a wholeyear and had always been the same moody and morose lounger therewhen he cared to talk he talked well but the cloud of caring fornothing which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness was veryrarely pierced by the light within him  and yet he did care something for the streets that environed thathouse and for the senseless stones that made their pavements manya night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there when wine had broughtno transitory gladness to him many a dreary daybreak revealed hissolitary figure lingering there and still lingering there when thefirst beams of the sun brought into strong relief removed beauties ofarchitecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings as perhaps thequiet time brought some sense of better things else forgotten andunattainable into his mind of late the neglected bed in thetemple court had known him more scantily than ever and often whenhe had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes he had gotup again and haunted that neighbourhood  on a day in august when mr stryver after notifying to hisjackal that he had thought better of that marrying matter hadcarried his delicacy into devonshire and when the sight and scentof flowers in the city streets had some waifs of goodness in themfor the worst of health for the sickliest and of youth for theoldest sydneys feet still trod those stones from being irresoluteand purposeless his feet became animated by an intention and in theworking out of that intention they took him to the doctors door  he was shown upstairs and found lucie at her work alone shehad never been quite at her ease with him and received him withsome little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table butlooking up at his face in the interchange of the first fewcommonplaces she observed a change in it  i fear you are not well mr carton  no but the life i lead miss manette is not conducive tohealth what is to be expected of or by such profligates  is it not forgive me i have begun the question on my lips a pityto live no better life  god knows it is a shame  then why not change it  looking gently at him again she was surprised and saddened to seethat there were tears in his eyes there were tears in his voicetoo as he answered  it is too late for that i shall never be better than i am i shallsink lower and be worse  he leaned an elbow on her table and covered his eyes with his handthe table trembled in the silence that followed  she had never seen him softened and was much distressed he knewher to be so without looking at her and said  pray forgive me miss manette i break down before the knowledge ofwhat i want to say to you will you hear me  if it will do you any good mr carton if it would make youhappier it would make me very glad  god bless you for your sweet compassion  he unshaded his face after a little while and spoke steadily  dont be afraid to hear me dont shrink from anything i say iam like one who died young all my life might have been  no mr carton i am sure that the best part of it might stillbe i am sure that you might be much much worthier of yourself  say of you miss manette and although i know better although inthe mystery of my own wretched heart i know better i shall neverforget it  she was pale and trembling he came to her relief with a fixeddespair of himself which made the interview unlike any other thatcould have been holden  if it had been possible miss manette that you could have returnedthe love of the man you see before you selfflung away wasteddrunken poor creature of misuse as you know him to be he wouldhave been conscious this day and hour in spite of his happiness thathe would bring you to misery bring you to sorrow and repentanceblight you disgrace you pull you down with him i know very wellthat you can have no tenderness for me i ask for none i am eventhankful that it cannot be  without it can i not save you mr carton can i not recall youforgive me again to a better course can i in no way repay yourconfidence i know this is a confidence she modestly said after alittle hesitation and in earnest tears i know you would say this tono one else can i turn it to no good account for yourself mrcarton  he shook his head  to none no miss manette to none if you will hear me through avery little more all you can ever do for me is done i wish you toknow that you have been the last dream of my soul in my degradation ihave not been so degraded but that the sight of you with yourfather and of this home made such a home by you has stirred oldshadows that i thought had died out of me since i knew you i havebeen troubled by a remorse that i thought would never reproach meagain and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upwardthat i thought were silent for ever i have had unformed ideas ofstriving afresh beginning anew shaking off sloth and sensuality andfighting out the abandoned fight a dream all a dream that ends innothing and leaves the sleeper where he lay down but i wish you toknow that you inspired it  will nothing of it remain o mr carton think again try again  no miss manette all through it i have known myself to be quiteundeserving and yet i have had the weakness and have still theweakness to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindledme heap of ashes that i am into fire a fire however inseparablein its nature from myself quickening nothing lighting nothing doingno service idly burning away  since it is my misfortune mr carton to have made you moreunhappy than you were before you knew me  dont say that miss manette for you would have reclaimed me ifanything could you will not be the cause of my becoming worse  since the state of your mind that you describe is at allevents attributable to some influence of mine this is what i meanif i can make it plain can i use no influence to serve you have i nopower for good with you at all  the utmost good that i am capable of now miss manette i have comehere to realise let me carry through the rest of my misdirected lifethe remembrance that i opened my heart to you last of all theworld and that there was something left in me at this time whichyou could deplore and pity  which i entreated you to believe again and again mostfervently with all my heart was capable of better things mrcarton  entreat me to believe it no more miss manette i have provedmyself and i know better i distress you i draw fast to an end willyou let me believe when i recall this day that the last confidenceof my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast and that itlies there alone and will be shared by no one  if that will be a consolation to you yes  not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you  mr carton she answered after an agitated pause the secretis yours not mine and i promise to respect it  thank you and again god bless you  he put her hand to his lips and moved towards the door  be under no apprehension miss manette of my ever resuming thisconversation by so much as a passing word i will never refer to itagain if i were dead that could not be surer than it ishenceforth in the hour of my death i shall hold sacred the onegood remembrance and shall thank and bless you for it that my lastavowal of myself was made to you and that my name and faults andmiseries were gently carried in your heart may it otherwise belight and happy  he was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be and it was sosad to think how much he had thrown away and how much he every daykept down and perverted that lucie manette wept mournfully for him ashe stood looking back at her  be comforted he said i am not worth such feeling miss manettean hour or two hence and the low companions and low habits that iscorn but yield to will render me less worth such tears as thosethan any wretch who creeps along the streets be comforted butwithin myself i shall always be towards you what i am now thoughoutwardly i shall be what you have heretofore seen me the lastsupplication but one i make to you is that you will believe thisof me  i will mr carton  my last supplication of all is this and with it i will relieveyou of a visitor with whom i well know you have nothing in unison andbetween whom and you there is an impassable space it is useless tosay it i know but it rises out of my soul for you and for any dearto you i would do anything if my career were of that better kindthat there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it i wouldembrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you try to holdme in your mind at some quiet times as ardent and sincere in thisone thing the time will come the time will not be long in comingwhen new ties will be formed about you ties that will bind you yetmore tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn the dearestties that will ever grace and gladden you o miss manette when thelittle picture of a happy fathers face looks up in yours when yousee your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet think nowand then that there is a man who would give his life to keep a lifeyou love beside you  he said farewell said a last god bless you and left her  xiv  the honest tradesman  to the eyes of mr jeremiah cruncher sitting on his stool infleetstreet with his grisly urchin beside him a vast number andvariety of objects in movement were every day presented who could situpon anything in fleetstreet during the busy hours of the day andnot be dazed and deafened by two immense processions one ever tendingwestward with the sun the other ever tending eastward from the sunboth ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purplewhere the sun goes down  with his straw in his mouth mr cruncher sat watching the twostreams like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been onduty watching one stream saving that jerry had no expectation oftheir ever running dry nor would it have been an expectation of ahopeful kind since a small part of his income was derived from thepilotage of timid women mostly of a full habit and past the middleterm of life from tellsons side of the tides to the oppositeshore brief as such companionship was in every separate instance mrcruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as toexpress a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very goodhealth and it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards theexecution of this benevolent purpose that he recruited hisfinances as just now observed  time was when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place andmused in the sight of men mr cruncher sitting on a stool in apublic place but not being a poet mused as little as possible andlooked about him  it fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds werefew and belated women few and when his affairs in general were sounprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that mrscruncher must have been flopping in some pointed manner when anunusual concourse pouring down fleetstreet westward attracted hisattention looking that way mr cruncher made out that some kind offuneral was coming along and that there was popular objection to thisfuneral which engendered uproar  young jerry said mr cruncher turning to his offspring itsa buryin  hooroar father cried young jerry  the young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterioussignificance the elder gentleman took the cry so ill that he watchedhis opportunity and smote the young gentleman on the ear  what dye mean what are you hooroaring at what do you want toconvey to your own father you young rip this boy is a getting toomany for me said mr cruncher surveying him him and his hooroarsdont let me hear no more of you or you shall feel some more of medye hear  i warnt doing no harm young jerry protested rubbing his cheek  drop it then said mr cruncher i wont have none of your noharms get a top of that there seat and look at the crowd  his son obeyed and the crowd approached they were bawling andhissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach in whichmourning coach there was only one mourner dressed in the dingytrappings that were considered essential to the dignity of theposition the position appeared by no means to please him howeverwith an increasing rabble surrounding the coach deriding himmaking grimaces at him and incessantly groaning and calling outyah spies tst yaha spies with many compliments too numerous andforcible to repeat  funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for mrcruncher he always pricked up his senses and became excited whena funeral passed tellsons naturally therefore a funeral withthis uncommon attendance excited him greatly and he asked of thefirst man who ran against him  what is it brother whats it about  i dont know said the man spies yaha tst spies  he asked another man who is it  i dont know returned the man clapping his hands to his mouthnevertheless and vociferating in a surprising heat and with thegreatest ardour spies yaha tst tst spiies  at length a person better informed on the merits of the casetumbled against him and from this person he learned that thefuneral was the funeral of one roger cly  was he a spy asked mr cruncher  old bailey spy returned his informant yaha tst yah oldbailey spiiies  why to be sure exclaimed jerry recalling the trial at whichhe had assisted ive seen him dead is he  dead as mutton returned the other and cant be too dead haveem out there spies pull em out there spies  the idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any ideathat the crowd caught it up with eagerness and loudly repeating thesuggestion to have em out and to pull em out mobbed the twovehicles so closely that they came to a stop on the crowds openingthe coach doors the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was intheir hands for a moment but he was so alert and made such gooduse of his time that in another moment he was scouring away up abyestreet after shedding his cloak hat long hatband whitepockethandkerchief and other symbolical tears  these the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide withgreat enjoyment while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shopsfor a crowd in those times stopped at nothing and was a monstermuch dreaded they had already got the length of opening the hearse totake the coffin out when some brighter genius proposed instead itsbeing escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicingpractical suggestions being much needed this suggestion too wasreceived with acclamation and the coach was immediately filled witheight inside and a dozen out while as many people got on the roofof the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon itamong the first of these volunteers was jerry cruncher himself whomodestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of tellsonsin the further corner of the mourning coach  the officiating undertakers made some protest against thesechanges in the ceremonies but the river being alarmingly near andseveral voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringingrefractory members of the profession to reason the protest wasfaint and brief the remodelled procession started with achimneysweep driving the hearse advised by the regular driver whowas perched beside him under close inspection for the purpose andwith a pieman also attended by his cabinet minister driving themourning coach a bearleader a popular street character of the timewas impressed as an additional ornament before the cavalcade had gonefar down the strand and his bear who was black and very mangygave quite an undertaking air to that part of the procession inwhich he walked  thus with beerdrinking pipesmoking songroaring and infinitecaricaturing of woe the disorderly procession went its wayrecruiting at every step and all the shops shutting up before it itsdestination was the old church of saint pancras far off in thefields it got there in course of time insisted on pouring into theburialground finally accomplished the interment of the deceasedroger cly in its own way and highly to its own satisfaction  the dead man disposed of and the crowd being under the necessity ofproviding some other entertainment for itself another brighter geniusor perhaps the same conceived the humour of impeaching casualpassersby as old bailey spies and wreaking vengeance on them chasewas given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never beennear the old bailey in their lives in the realisation of thisfancy and they were roughly hustled and maltreated the transition tothe sport of windowbreaking and thence to the plundering ofpublichouses was easy and natural at last after several hourswhen sundry summer houses had been pulled down and some arearailingshad been torn up to arm the more belligerent spirits a rumour gotabout that the guards were coming before this rumour the crowdgradually melted away and perhaps the guards came and perhaps theynever came and this was the usual progress of a mob  mr cruncher did not assist at the closing sports but hadremained behind in the churchyard to confer and condole with theundertakers the place had a soothing influence on him he procureda pipe from a neighbouring publichouse and smoked it looking inat the railings and maturely considering the spot  jerry said mr cruncher apostrophising himself in his usual wayyou see that there cly that day and you see with your own eyesthat he was a young un and a straight made un  having smoked his pipe out and ruminated a little longer he turnedhimself about that he might appear before the hour of closing onhis station at tellsons whether his meditations on mortality hadtouched his liver or whether his general health had been previouslyat all amiss or whether he desired to show a little attention to aneminent man is not so much to the purpose as that he made a shortcall upon his medical adviser a distinguished surgeon on his wayback  young jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest andreported no job in his absence the bank closed the ancient clerkscame out the usual watch was set and mr cruncher and his son wenthome to tea  now i tell you where it is said mr cruncher to his wife onentering if as a honest tradesman my wenturs goes wrongtonight i shall make sure that youve been praying again me and ishall work you for it just the same as if i seen you do it  the dejected mrs cruncher shook her head  why youre at it afore my face said mr cruncher with signsof angry apprehension  i am saying nothing  well then dont meditate nothing you might as well flop asmeditate you may as well go again me one way as another drop italtogether  yes jerry  yes jerry repeated mr cruncher sitting down to tea ah itis yes jerry thats about it you may say yes jerry  mr cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulkycorroborations but made use of them as people not unfrequently doto express general ironical dissatisfaction  you and your yes jerry said mr cruncher taking a bite out ofhis breadandbutter and seeming to help it down with a largeinvisible oyster out of his saucer ah i think so i believe you  you are going out tonight asked his decent wife when he tookanother bite  yes i am  may i go with you father asked his son briskly  no you maynt im a going as your mother knows a fishingthats where im going to going a fishing  your fishingrod gets rayther rusty dont it father  never you mind  shall you bring any fish home father  if i dont youll have short commons tomorrow returned thatgentleman shaking his head thats questions enough for you i ainta going out till youve been long abed  he devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keepinga most vigilant watch on mrs cruncher and sullenly holding her inconversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitionsto his disadvantage with this view he urged his son to hold her inconversation also and led the unfortunate woman a hard life bydwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her ratherthan he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections thedevoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacyof an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife it wasas if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghoststory  and mind you said mr cruncher no games tomorrow if i as ahonest tradesman succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two none ofyour not touching of it and sticking to bread if i as a honesttradesman am able to provide a little beer none of your declaring onwater when you go to rome do as rome does rome will be a uglycustomer to you if you dont im your rome you know  then he began grumbling again  with your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink idont know how scarce you maynt make the wittles and drink here byyour flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct look at your boyhe is yourn aint he hes as thin as a lath do you call yourself amother and not know that a mothers first duty is to blow her boyout  this touched young jerry on a tender place who adjured his motherto perform her first duty and whatever else she did or neglectedabove all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of thatmaternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his otherparent  thus the evening wore away with the cruncher family until youngjerry was ordered to bed and his mother laid under similarinjunctions obeyed them mr cruncher beguiled the earlier watches ofthe night with solitary pipes and did not start upon his excursionuntil nearly one oclock towards that small and ghostly hour he roseup from his chair took a key out of his pocket opened a lockedcupboard and brought forth a sack a crowbar of convenient size arope and chain and other fishing tackle of that nature disposingthese articles about him in skilful manner he bestowed a partingdefiance on mrs cruncher extinguished the light and went out  young jerry who had only made a feint of undressing when he went tobed was not long after his father under cover of the darkness hefollowed out of the room followed down the stairs followed downthe court followed out into the streets he was in no uneasinessconcerning his getting into the house again for it was full oflodgers and the door stood ajar all night  impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery ofhis fathers honest calling young jerry keeping as close to housefronts walls and doorways as his eyes were close to one anotherheld his honoured parent in view the honoured parent steeringnorthward had not gone far when he was joined by another disciple ofizaak walton and the two trudged on together  within half an hour from the first starting they were beyond thewinking lamps and the more than winking watchmen and were out upon alonely road another fisherman was picked up here and that sosilently that if young jerry had been superstitious he might havesupposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have all of asudden split himself into two  the three went on and young jerry went on until the threestopped under a bank overhanging the road upon the top of the bankwas a low brick wall surmounted by an iron railing in the shadowof bank and wall the three turned out of the road and up a blindlane of which the wall there risen to some eight or ten feethigh formed one side crouching down in a corner peeping up thelane the next object that young jerry saw was the form of hishonoured parent pretty well defined against a watery and cloudedmoon nimbly scaling an iron gate he was soon over and then thesecond fisherman got over and then the third they all dropped softlyon the ground within the gate and lay there a little listeningperhaps then they moved away on their hands and knees  it was now young jerrys turn to approach the gate which he didholding his breath crouching down again in a corner there andlooking in he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rankgrass and all the gravestones in the churchyard it was a largechurchyard that they were in looking on like ghosts in white whilethe church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giantthey did not creep far before they stopped and stood upright andthen they began to fish  they fished with a spade at first presently the honoured parentappeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrewwhatever tools they worked with they worked hard until the awfulstriking of the church clock so terrified young jerry that he madeoff with his hair as stiff as his fathers  but his longcherished desire to know more about these matters notonly stopped him in his running away but lured him back again theywere still fishing perseveringly when he peeped in at the gate forthe second time but now they seemed to have got a bite there wasa screwing and complaining sound down below and their bent figureswere strained as if by a weight by slow degrees the weight brokeaway the earth upon it and came to the surface young jerry very wellknew what it would be but when he saw it and saw his honouredparent about to wrench it open he was so frightened being new to thesight that he made off again and never stopped until he had run amile or more  he would not have stopped then for anything less necessary thanbreath it being a spectral sort of race that he ran and one highlydesirable to get to the end of he had a strong idea that the coffinhe had seen was running after him and pictured as hopping onbehind him bolt upright upon its narrow end always on the pointof overtaking him and hopping on at his side perhaps taking hisarm it was a pursuer to shun it was an inconsistent and ubiquitousfiend too for while it was making the whole night behind himdreadful he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys fearfulof its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boyskitewithout tail and wings it hid in doorways too rubbing its horribleshoulders against doors and drawing them up to its ears as if itwere laughing it got into shadows on the road and lay cunningly onits back to trip him up all this time it was incessantly hopping onbehind and gaining on him so that when the boy got to his own door hehad reason for being half dead and even then it would not leavehim but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair scrambledinto bed with him and bumped down dead and heavy on his breast whenhe fell asleep  from his oppressed slumber young jerry in his closet was awakenedafter daybreak and before sunrise by the presence of his father inthe family room something had gone wrong with him at least so youngjerry inferred from the circumstance of his holding mrs cruncherby the ears and knocking the back of her head against theheadboard of the bed  i told you i would said mr cruncher and i did  jerry jerry jerry his wife implored  you oppose yourself to the profit of the business said jerryand me and my partners suffer you was to honour and obey why thedevil dont you  i try to be a good wife jerry the poor woman protested withtears  is it being a good wife to oppose your husbands business is ithonouring your husband to dishonour his business is it obeying yourhusband to disobey him on the vital subject of his business  you hadnt taken to the dreadful business then jerry  its enough for you retorted mr cruncher to be the wife of ahonest tradesman and not to occupy your female mind with calculationswhen he took to his trade or when he didnt a honouring and obeyingwife would let his trade alone altogether call yourself a religiouswoman if youre a religious woman give me a irreligious one youhave no more natral sense of duty than the bed of this here thamesriver has of a pile and similarly it must be knocked into you  the altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice and terminatedin the honest tradesmans kicking off his claysoiled boots and lyingdown at his length on the floor after taking a timid peep at himlying on his back with his rusty hands under his head for a pillowhis son lay down too and fell asleep again  there was no fish for breakfast and not much of anything elsemr cruncher was out of spirits and out of temper and kept an ironpotlid by him as a projectile for the correction of mrs cruncher incase he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace he wasbrushed and washed at the usual hour and set off with his son topursue his ostensible calling  young jerry walking with the stool under his arm at his fathersside along sunny and crowded fleetstreet was a very differentyoung jerry from him of the previous night running home throughdarkness and solitude from his grim pursuer his cunning was freshwith the day and his qualms were gone with the night in whichparticulars it is not improbable that he had compeers infleetstreet and the city of london that fine morning  father said young jerry as they walked along taking care tokeep at arms length and to have the stool well between themwhats a resurrectionman  mr cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered howshould i know  i thought you knowed everything father said the artless boy  hem well returned mr cruncher going on again and lifting ofhis hat to give his spikes free play hes a tradesman  whats his goods father asked the brisk young jerry  his goods said mr cruncher after turning it over in his mindis a branch of scientific goods  persons bodies aint it father asked the lively boy  i believe it is something of that sort said mr cruncher  oh father i should so like to be a resurrectionman when imquite growed up  mr cruncher was soothed but shook his head in a dubious andmoral way it depends upon how you develop your talents be carefulto develop your talents and never to say no more than you can help tonobody and theres no telling at the present time what you may notcome to be fit for as young jerry thus encouraged went on a fewyards in advance to plant the stool in the shadow of the bar mrcruncher added to himself jerry you honest tradesman theres hopeswot that boy will yet be a blessing to you and a recompense to youfor his mother  xv  knitting  there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wineshop ofmonsieur defarge as early as six oclock in the morning sallow facespeeping through its barred windows had descried other faces withinbending over measures of wine monsieur defarge sold a very thinwine at the best of times but it would seem to have been an unusuallythin wine that he sold at this time a sour wine moreover or asouring for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was tomake them gloomy no vivacious bacchanalian flame leaped out of thepressed grape of monsieur defarge but a smouldering fire thatburnt in the dark lay hidden in the dregs of it  this had been the third morning in succession on which there hadbeen early drinking at the wineshop of monsieur defarge it had begunon monday and here was wednesday come there had been more of earlybrooding than drinking for many men had listened and whispered andslunk about there from the time of the opening of the door whocould not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save theirsouls these were to the full as interested in the place howeveras if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine and they glidedfrom seat to seat and from corner to corner swallowing talk inlieu of drink with greedy looks  notwithstanding an unusual flow of company the master of thewineshop was not visible he was not missed for nobody who crossedthe threshold looked for him nobody asked for him nobody wondered tosee only madame defarge in her seat presiding over the distributionof wine with a bowl of battered small coins before her as muchdefaced and beaten out of their original impress as the smallcoinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come  a suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind were perhapsobserved by the spies who looked in at the wineshop as they lookedin at every place high and low from the kings palace to thecriminals gaol games at cards languished players at dominoesmusingly built towers with them drinkers drew figures on the tableswith spilt drops of wine madame defarge herself picked out thepattern on her sleeve with her toothpick and saw and heardsomething inaudible and invisible a long way off  thus saint antoine in this vinous feature of his until middayit was high noontide when two dusty men passed through his streetsand under his swinging lamps of whom one was monsieur defarge theother a mender of roads in a blue cap ah adust and athirst the twoentered the wineshop their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in thebreast of saint antoine fast spreading as they came along whichstirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windowsyet no one had followed them and no man spoke when they enteredthe wineshop though the eyes of every man there were turned uponthem  good day gentlemen said monsieur defarge  it may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue itelicited an answering chorus of good day  it is bad weather gentlemen said defarge shaking his head  upon which every man looked at his neighbour and then all castdown their eyes and sat silent except one man who got up and wentout  my wife said defarge aloud addressing madame defarge i havetravelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads calledjacques i met him by accident a day and halfs journey out ofparis he is a good child this mender of roads called jacquesgive him to drink my wife  a second man got up and went out madame defarge set wine before themender of roads called jacques who doffed his blue cap to thecompany and drank in the breast of his blouse he carried some coarsedark bread he ate of this between whiles and sat munching anddrinking near madame defarges counter a third man got up and wentout  defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine but he tookless than was given to the stranger as being himself a man to whom itwas no rarity and stood waiting until the countryman had made hisbreakfast he looked at no one present and no one now looked athim not even madame defarge who had taken up her knitting and wasat work  have you finished your repast friend he asked in due season  yes thank you  come then you shall see the apartment that i told you you occupyit will suit you to a marvel  out of the wineshop into the street out of the street into acourtyard out of the courtyard up a steep staircase out of thestaircase into a garret formerly the garret where a whitehaired mansat on a low bench stooping forward and very busy making shoes  no whitehaired man was there now but the three men were there whohad gone out of the wineshop singly and between them and thewhitehaired man afar off was the one small link that they hadonce looked in at him through the chinks in the wall  defarge closed the door carefully and spoke in a subdued voice  jacques one jacques two jacques three this is the witnessencountered by appointment by me jacques four he will tell you allspeak jacques five  the mender of roads blue cap in hand wiped his swarthy foreheadwith it and said where shall i commence monsieur  commence was monsieur defarges not unreasonable reply at thecommencement  i saw him then messieurs began the mender of roads a yearago this running summer underneath the carriage of the marquishanging by the chain behold the manner of it i leaving my work onthe road the sun going to bed the carriage of the marquis slowlyascending the hill he hanging by the chainlike this  again the mender of roads went through the whole performance inwhich he ought to have been perfect by that time seeing that it hadbeen the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of hisvillage during a whole year  jacques one struck in and asked if he had ever seen the man before  never answered the mender of roads recovering his perpendicular  jacques three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then  by his tall figure said the mender of roads softly and with hisfinger at his nose when monsieur the marquis demands that eveningsay what is he like i make response tall as a spectre  you should have said short as a dwarf returned jacques two  but what did i know the deed was not then accomplished neitherdid he confide in me observe under those circumstances even i donot offer my testimony monsieur the marquis indicates me with hisfinger standing near our little fountain and says to me bringthat rascal my faith messieurs i offer nothing  he is right there jacques murmured defarge to him who hadinterrupted go on  good said the mender of roads with an air of mystery thetall man is lost and he is sought how many months nine teneleven  no matter the number said defarge he is well hidden but atlast he is unluckily found go on  i am again at work upon the hillside and the sun is again aboutto go to bed i am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage downin the village below where it is already dark when i raise myeyes and see coming over the hill six soldiers in the midst ofthem is a tall man with his arms bound tied to his sides like this  with the aid of his indispensable cap he represented a man with hiselbows bound fast at his hips with cords that were knotted behindhim  i stand aside messieurs by my heap of stones to see the soldiersand their prisoner pass for it is a solitary road that where anyspectacle is well worth looking at and at first as they approach isee no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound andthat they are almost black to my sight except on the side of thesun going to bed where they have a red edge messieurs also i seethat their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite sideof the road and are on the hill above it and are like the shadows ofgiants also i see that they are covered with dust and that the dustmoves with them as they come tramp tramp but when they advancequite near to me i recognise the tall man and he recognises meah but he would be well content to precipitate himself over thehillside once again as on the evening when he and i firstencountered close to the same spot  he described it as if he were there and it was evident that hesaw it vividly perhaps he had not seen much in his life  i do not show the soldiers that i recognise the tall man he doesnot show the soldiers that he recognises me we do it and we know itwith our eyes come on says the chief of that company pointingto the village bring him fast to his tomb and they bring himfaster i follow his arms are swelled because of being bound sotight his wooden shoes are large and clumsy and he is lamebecause he is lame and consequently slow they drive him with theirgunslike this  he imitated the action of a mans being impelled forward by thebuttends of muskets  as they descend the hill like madmen running a race he falls theylaugh and pick him up again his face is bleeding and covered withdust but he cannot touch it thereupon they laugh again they bringhim into the village all the village runs to look they take him pastthe mill and up to the prison all the village sees the prison gateopen in the darkness of the night and swallow him like this  he opened his mouth as wide as he could and shut it with a soundingsnap of his teeth observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect byopening it again defarge said go on jacques  all the village pursued the mender of roads on tiptoe and in alow voice withdraws all the village whispers by the fountain allthe village sleeps all the village dreams of that unhappy one withinthe locks and bars of the prison on the crag and never to come out ofit except to perish in the morning with my tools upon myshoulder eating my morsel of black bread as i go i make a circuit bythe prison on my way to my work there i see him high up behind thebars of a lofty iron cage bloody and dusty as last night lookingthrough he has no hand free to wave to me i dare not call to himhe regards me like a dead man  defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another the looks ofall of them were dark repressed and revengeful as they listenedto the countrymans story the manner of all of them while it wassecret was authoritative too they had the air of a rough tribunaljacques one and two sitting on the old palletbed each with hischin resting on his hand and his eyes intent on the roadmenderjacques three equally intent on one knee behind them with hisagitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about hismouth and nose defarge standing between them and the narrator whomhe had stationed in the light of the window by turns looking from himto them and from them to him  go on jacques said defarge  he remains up there in his iron cage some days the village looksat him by stealth for it is afraid but it always looks up from adistance at the prison on the crag and in the evening when the workof the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain allfaces are turned towards the prison formerly they were turnedtowards the postinghouse now they are turned towards the prisonthey whisper at the fountain that although condemned to death he willnot be executed they say that petitions have been presented in parisshowing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his childthey say that a petition has been presented to the king himselfwhat do i know it is possible perhaps yes perhaps no  listen then jacques number one of that name sternlyinterposed know that a petition was presented to the king and queenall here yourself excepted saw the king take it in his carriagein the street sitting beside the queen it is defarge whom you seehere who at the hazard of his life darted out before the horseswith the petition in his hand  and once again listen jacques said the kneeling number threehis fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves with astrikingly greedy air as if he hungered for something that wasneither food nor drink the guard horse and foot surrounded thepetitioner and struck him blows you hear  i hear messieurs  go on then said defarge  again on the other hand they whisper at the fountain resumedthe countryman that he is brought down into our country to beexecuted on the spot and that he will very certainly be executedthey even whisper that because he has slain monseigneur and becausemonseigneur was the father of his tenants serfs what you will hewill be executed as a parricide one old man says at the fountainthat his right hand armed with the knife will be burnt off beforehis face that into wounds which will be made in his arms hisbreast and his legs there will be poured boiling oil melted leadhot resin wax and sulphur finally that he will be torn limb fromlimb by four strong horses that old man says all this was actuallydone to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late kinglouis fifteen but how do i know if he lies i am not a scholar  listen once again then jacques said the man with the restlesshand and the craving air the name of that prisoner was damiensand it was all done in open day in the open streets of this city ofparis and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that sawit done than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion who were funof eager attention to the last to the last jacques prolongeduntil nightfall when he had lost two legs and an arm and stillbreathed and it was done why how old are you  thirtyfive said the mender of roads who looked sixty  it was done when you were more than ten years old you might haveseen it  enough said defarge with grim impatience long live thedevil go on  well some whisper this some whisper that they speak of nothingelse even the fountain appears to fall to that tune at length onsunday night when all the village is asleep come soldiers windingdown from the prison and their guns ring on the stones of thelittle street workmen dig workmen hammer soldiers laugh and singin the morning by the fountain there is raised a gallows fortyfeet high poisoning the water  the mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceilingand pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky  all work is stopped all assemble there nobody leads the cows outthe cows are there with the rest at midday the roll of drumssoldiers have marched into the prison in the night and he is in themidst of many soldiers he is bound as before and in his mouththere is a gagtied so with a tight string making him look almost asif he laughed he suggested it by creasing his face with his twothumbs from the corners of his mouth to his ears on the top ofthe gallows is fixed the knife blade upwards with its point in theair he is hanged there forty feet high and is left hangingpoisoning the water  they looked at one another as he used his blue cap to wipe hisface on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalledthe spectacle  it is frightful messieurs how can the women and the children drawwater who can gossip of an evening under that shadow under it havei said when i left the village monday evening as the sun was goingto bed and looked back from the hill the shadow struck across thechurch across the mill across the prison seemed to strike acrossthe earth messieurs to where the sky rests upon it  the hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the otherthree and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him  thats all messieurs i left at sunset as i had been warned todo and i walked on that night and half next day until i met asi was warned i should this comrade with him i came on now ridingand now walking through the rest of yesterday and through last nightand here you see me  after a gloomy silence the first jacques said good you haveacted and recounted faithfully will you wait for us a little outsidethe door  very willingly said the mender of roads whom defarge escorted tothe top of the stairs and leaving seated there returned  the three had risen and their heads were together when he came backto the garret  how say you jacques demanded number one to be registered  to be registered as doomed to destruction returned defarge  magnificent croaked the man with the craving  the chateau and all the race inquired the first  the chateau and all the race returned defarge extermination  the hungry man repeated in a rapturous croak magnificent andbegan gnawing another finger  are you sure asked jacques two of defarge that noembarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the registerwithout doubt it is safe for no one beyond ourselves can decipher itbut shall we always be able to decipher it or i ought to say willshe  jacques returned defarge drawing himself up if madame mywife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone she would notlose a word of it not a syllable of it knitted in her ownstitches and her own symbols it will always be as plain to her as thesun confide in madame defarge it would be easier for the weakestpoltroon that lives to erase himself from existence than to eraseone letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of madamedefarge  there was a murmur of confidence and approval and then the manwho hungered asked is this rustic to be sent back soon i hopeso he is very simple is he not a little dangerous  he knows nothing said defarge at least nothing more thanwould easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height i chargemyself with him let him remain with me i will take care of himand set him on his road he wishes to see the fine world the kingthe queen and court let him see them on sunday  what exclaimed the hungry man staring is it a good signthat he wishes to see royalty and nobility  jacques said defarge judiciously show a cat milk if you wishher to thirst for it judiciously show a dog his natural prey ifyou wish him to bring it down one day  nothing more was said and the mender of roads being foundalready dozing on the topmost stair was advised to lay himself downon the palletbed and take some rest he needed no persuasion and wassoon asleep  worse quarters than defarges wineshop could easily have beenfound in paris for a provincial slave of that degree saving for amysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted hislife was very new and agreeable but madame sat all day at hercounter so expressly unconscious of him and so particularlydetermined not to perceive that his being there had any connectionwith anything below the surface that he shook in his wooden shoeswhenever his eye lighted on her for he contended with himself thatit was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next and hefelt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamentedhead to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwardsflay the victim she would infallibly go through with it until theplay was played out  therefore when sunday came the mender of roads was not enchantedthough he said he was to find that madame was to accompanymonsieur and himself to versailles it was additionallydisconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there in a publicconveyance it was additionally disconcerting yet to have madame inthe crowd in the afternoon still with her knitting in her hands asthe crowd waited to see the carriage of the king and queen  you work hard madame said a man near her  yes answered madame defarge i have a good deal to do  what do you make madame  many things  for instance  for instance returned madame defarge composedly shrouds  the man moved a little further away as soon as he could and themender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap feeling itmightily close and oppressive if he needed a king and queen torestore him he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand forsoon the largefaced king and the fairfaced queen came in theirgolden coach attended by the shining bulls eye of their court aglittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords and injewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurningfigures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes the mender ofroads bathed himself so much to his temporary intoxication that hecried long live the king long live the queen long live everybody andeverything as if he had never heard of ubiquitous jacques in histime then there were gardens courtyards terraces fountains greenbanks more king and queen more bulls eye more lords and ladiesmore long live they all until he absolutely wept with sentimentduring the whole of this scene which lasted some three hours hehad plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company andthroughout defarge held him by the collar as if to restrain himfrom flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them topieces  bravo said defarge clapping him on the back when it was overlike a patron you are a good boy  the mender of roads was now coming to himself and was mistrustfulof having made a mistake in his late demonstrations but no  you are the fellow we want said defarge in his ear you makethese fools believe that it will last for ever then they are themore insolent and it is the nearer ended  hey cried the mender of roads reflectively thats true  these fools know nothing while they despise your breath and wouldstop it for ever and ever in you or in a hundred like you rather thanin one of their own horses or dogs they only know what your breathtells them let it deceive them then a little longer it cannotdeceive them too much  madame defarge looked superciliously at the client and nodded inconfirmation  as to you said she you would shout and shed tears for anythingif it made a show and a noise say would you not  truly madame i think so for the moment  if you were shown a great heap of dolls and were set upon themto pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage youwould pick out the richest and gayest say would you not  truly yes madame  yes and if you were shown a flock of birds unable to fly andwere set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your ownadvantage you would set upon the birds of the finest featherswould you not  it is true madame  you have seen both dolls and birds today said madame defargewith a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last beenapparent now go home  xvi  still knitting  madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to thebosom of saint antoine while a speck in a blue cap toiled through thedarkness and through the dust and down the weary miles of avenueby the wayside slowly tending towards that point of the compass wherethe chateau of monsieur the marquis now in his grave listened to thewhispering trees such ample leisure had the stone faces now forlistening to the trees and to the fountain that the few villagescarecrows who in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments ofdead stick to burn strayed within sight of the great stonecourtyard and terrace staircase had it borne in upon their starvedfancy that the expression of the faces was altered a rumour justlived in the village had a faint and bare existence there as itspeople had that when the knife struck home the faces changed fromfaces of pride to faces of anger and pain also that when thatdangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain theychanged again and bore a cruel look of being avenged which theywould henceforth bear for ever in the stone face over the greatwindow of the bedchamber where the murder was done two fine dintswere pointed out in the sculptured nose which everybody recognisedand which nobody had seen of old and on the scarce occasions when twoor three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peepat monsieur the marquis petrified a skinny finger would not havepointed to it for a minute before they all started away among themoss and leaves like the more fortunate hares who could find a livingthere  chateau and hut stone face and dangling figure the red stain onthe stone floor and the pure water in the village well thousandsof acres of land a whole province of france all france itself layunder the night sky concentrated into a faint hairbreadth line sodoes a whole world with all its greatnesses and littlenesses liein a twinkling star and as mere human knowledge can split a ray oflight and analyse the manner of its composition so sublimerintelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of oursevery thought and act every vice and virtue of every responsiblecreature on it  the defarges husband and wife came lumbering under thestarlight in their public vehicle to that gate of paris whereuntotheir journey naturally tended there was the usual stoppage at thebarrier guardhouse and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for theusual examination and inquiry monsieur defarge alighted knowingone or two of the soldiery there and one of the police the latter hewas intimate with and affectionately embraced  when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarges in his duskywings and they having finally alighted near the saintsboundaries were picking their way on foot through the black mud andoffal of his streets madame defarge spoke to her husband  say then my friend what did jacques of the police tell thee  very little tonight but all he knows there is another spycommissioned for our quarter there may be many more for all thathe can say but he knows of one  eh well said madame defarge raising her eyebrows with a coolbusiness air it is necessary to register him how do they callthat man  he is english  so much the better his name  barsad said defarge making it french by pronunciation but hehad been so careful to get it accurately that he then spelt it withperfect correctness  barsad repeated madame good christian name  john  john barsad repeated madame after murmuring it once toherself good his appearance is it known  age about forty years height about five feet nine black haircomplexion dark generally rather handsome visage eyes dark facethin long and sallow nose aquiline but not straight having apeculiar inclination towards the left cheek expression thereforesinister  eh my faith it is a portrait said madame laughing he shall beregistered tomorrow  they turned into the wineshop which was closed for it wasmidnight and where madame defarge immediately took her post at herdesk counted the small moneys that had been taken during herabsence examined the stock went through the entries in the book madeother entries of her own checked the serving man in every possibleway and finally dismissed him to bed then she turned out thecontents of the bowl of money for the second time and beganknotting them up in her handkerchief in a chain of separate knotsfor safe keeping through the night all this while defarge withhis pipe in his mouth walked up and down complacently admiringbut never interfering in which condition indeed as to thebusiness and his domestic affairs he walked up and down through life  the night was hot and the shop close shut and surrounded by sofoul a neighbourhood was illsmelling monsieur defarges olfactorysense was by no means delicate but the stock of wine smelt muchstronger than it ever tasted and so did the stock of rum and brandyand aniseed he whiffed the compound of scents away as he put downhis smokedout pipe  you are fatigued said madame raising her glance as she knottedthe money there are only the usual odours  i am a little tired her husband acknowledged  you are a little depressed too said madame whose quick eyes hadnever been so intent on the accounts but they had had a ray or twofor him oh the men the men  but my dear began defarge  but my dear repeated madame nodding firmly but my dear  you are faint of heart tonight my dear  well then said defarge as if a thought were wrung out of hisbreast it is a long time  it is a long time repeated his wife and when is it not a longtime vengeance and retribution require a long time it is the rule  it does not take a long time to strike a man with lightningsaid defarge  how long demanded madame composedly does it take to make andstore the lightning tell me  defarge raised his head thoughtfully as if there were somethingin that too  it does not take a long time said madame for an earthquake toswallow a town eh well tell me how long it takes to prepare theearthquake  a long time i suppose said defarge  but when it is ready it takes place and grinds to pieceseverything before it in the meantime it is always preparingthough it is not seen or heard that is your consolation keep it  she tied a knot with flashing eyes as if it throttled a foe  i tell thee said madame extending her right hand foremphasis that although it is a long time on the road it is on theroad and coming i tell thee it never retreats and never stops itell thee it is always advancing look around and consider the livesof all the world that we know consider the faces of all the worldthat we know consider the rage and discontent to which thejacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hourcan such things last bah i mock you  my brave wife returned defarge standing before her with his heada little bent and his hands clasped at his back like a docile andattentive pupil before his catechist i do not question all this butit has lasted a long time and it is possible you know well my wifeit is possible that it may not come during our lives  eh well how then demanded madame tying another knot as ifthere were another enemy strangled  well said defarge with a half complaining and half apologeticshrug we shall not see the triumph  we shall have helped it returned madame with her extended handin strong action nothing that we do is done in vain i believewith all my soul that we shall see the triumph but even if not evenif i knew certainly not show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrantand still i would  then madame with her teeth set tied a very terrible knot indeed  hold cried defarge reddening a little as if he felt charged withcowardice i too my dear will stop at nothing  yes but it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see yourvictim and your opportunity to sustain you sustain yourselfwithout that when the time comes let loose a tiger and a devilbut wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chained not shownyet always ready  madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by strikingher little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked itsbrains out and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm ina serene manner and observing that it was time to go to bed  next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in thewineshop knitting away assiduously a rose lay beside her and ifshe now and then glanced at the flower it was with no infraction ofher usual preoccupied air there were a few customers drinking or notdrinking standing or seated sprinkled about the day was very hotand heaps of flies who were extending their inquisitive andadventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses nearmadame fell dead at the bottom their decease made no impression onthe other flies out promenading who looked at them in the coolestmanner as if they themselves were elephants or something as farremoved until they met the same fate curious to consider howheedless flies are perhaps they thought as much at court thatsunny summer day  a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge whichshe felt to be a new one she laid down her knitting and began to pinher rose in her headdress before she looked at the figure  it was curious the moment madame defarge took up the rose thecustomers ceased talking and began gradually to drop out of thewineshop  good day madame said the newcomer  good day monsieur  she said it aloud but added to herself as she resumed herknitting hah good day age about forty height about five feetnine black hair generally rather handsome visage complexion darkeyes dark thin long and sallow face aquiline nose but not straighthaving a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts asinister expression good day one and all  have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac and amouthful of cool fresh water madame  madame complied with a polite air  marvellous cognac this madame  it was the first time it had ever been so complimented and madamedefarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better she saidhowever that the cognac was flattered and took up her knittingthe visitor watched her fingers for a few moments and took theopportunity of observing the place in general  you knit with great skill madame  i am accustomed to it  a pretty pattern too  you think so said madame looking at him with a smile  decidedly may one ask what it is for  pastime said madame still looking at him with a smile whileher fingers moved nimbly  not for use  that depends i may find a use for it one day if i do wellsaid madame drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kindof coquetry ill use it  it was remarkable but the taste of saint antoine seemed to bedecidedly opposed to a rose on the headdress of madame defarge twomen had entered separately and had been about to order drink whencatching sight of that novelty they faltered made a pretence oflooking about as if for some friend who was not there and wentaway nor of those who had been there when this visitor enteredwas there one left they had all dropped off the spy had kept hiseyes open but had been able to detect no sign they had loungedaway in a poverty stricken purposeless accidental manner quitenatural and unimpeachable  john thought madame checking off her work as her fingersknitted and her eyes looked at the stranger stay long enough and ishall knit barsad before you go  you have a husband madame  i have  children  no children  business seems bad  business is very bad the people are so poor  ah the unfortunate miserable people so oppressed too as yousay  as you say madame retorted correcting him and deftly knittingan extra something into his name that boded him no good  pardon me certainly it was i who said so but you naturallythink so of course  i think returned madame in a high voice i and my husbandhave enough to do to keep this wineshop open without thinking allwe think here is how to live that is the subject we think of andit gives us from morning to night enough to think about withoutembarrassing our heads concerning others i think for others no no   the spy who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or makedid not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinisterface but stood with an air of gossiping gallantry leaning his elbowon madame defarges little counter and occasionally sipping hiscognac  a bad business this madame of gaspards execution ah the poorgaspard with a sigh of great compassion  my faith returned madame coolly and lightly if people useknives for such purposes they have to pay for it he knewbeforehand what the price of his luxury was he has paid the price  i believe said the spy dropping his soft voice to a tone thatinvited confidence and expressing an injured revolutionarysusceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face i believe there ismuch compassion and anger in this neighbourhood touching the poorfellow between ourselves  is there asked madame vacantly  is there not  here is my husband said madame defarge  as the keeper of the wineshop entered at the door the spysaluted him by touching his hat and saying with an engaging smilegood day jacques defarge stopped short and stared at him  good day jacques the spy repeated with not quite so muchconfidence or quite so easy a smile under the stare  you deceive yourself monsieur returned the keeper of thewineshop you mistake me for another that is not my name i amernest defarge  it is all the same said the spy airily but discomfited toogood day  good day answered defarge drily  i was saying to madame with whom i had the pleasure of chattingwhen you entered that they tell me there is and no wonder muchsympathy and anger in saint antoine touching the unhappy fate of poorgaspard  no one has told me so said defarge shaking his head i knownothing of it  having said it he passed behind the little counter and stoodwith his hand on the back of his wifes chair looking over thatbarrier at the person to whom they were both opposed and whomeither of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction  the spy well used to his business did not change his unconsciousattitude but drained his little glass of cognac took a sip offresh water and asked for another glass of cognac madame defargepoured it out for him took to her knitting again and hummed a littlesong over it  you seem to know this quarter well that is to say better than ido observed defarge  not at all but i hope to know it better i am so profoundlyinterested in its miserable inhabitants  hah muttered defarge  the pleasure of conversing with you monsieur defarge recalls tome pursued the spy that i have the honour of cherishing someinteresting associations with your name  indeed said defarge with much indifference  yes indeed when doctor manette was released you his olddomestic had the charge of him i know he was delivered to youyou see i am informed of the circumstances  such is the fact certainly said defarge he had had itconveyed to him in an accidental touch of his wifes elbow as sheknitted and warbled that he would do best to answer but alwayswith brevity  it was to you said the spy that his daughter came and it wasfrom your care that his daughter took him accompanied by a neat brownmonsieur how is he called in a little wig lorry of the bank oftellson and company over to england  such is the fact repeated defarge  very interesting remembrances said the spy i have knowndoctor manette and his daughter in england  yes said defarge  you dont hear much about them now said the spy  no said defarge  in effect madame struck in looking up from her work and herlittle song we never hear about them we received the news oftheir safe arrival and perhaps another letter or perhaps two butsince then they have gradually taken their road in life we oursand we have held no correspondence  perfectly so madame replied the spy she is going to bemarried  going echoed madame she was pretty enough to have beenmarried long ago you english are cold it seems to me  oh you know i am english  i perceive your tongue is returned madame and what the tongueis i suppose the man is  he did not take the identification as a compliment but he madethe best of it and turned it off with a laugh after sipping hiscognac to the end he added  yes miss manette is going to be married but not to an englishmanto one who like herself is french by birth and speaking ofgaspard ah poor gaspard it was cruel cruel it is a curiousthing that she is going to marry the nephew of monsieur the marquisfor whom gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet inother words the present marquis but he lives unknown in englandhe is no marquis there he is mr charles darnay daulnais is thename of his mothers family  madame defarge knitted steadily but the intelligence had a palpableeffect upon her husband do what he would behind the littlecounter as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipehe was troubled and his hand was not trustworthy the spy wouldhave been no spy if he had failed to see it or to record it in hismind  having made at least this one hit whatever it might prove to beworth and no customers coming in to help him to any other mr barsadpaid for what he had drunk and took his leave taking occasion tosay in a genteel manner before he departed that he looked forwardto the pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again forsome minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of saintantoine the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left themlest he should come back  can it be true said defarge in a low voice looking down athis wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chairwhat he has said of maamselle manette  as he has said it returned madame lifting her eyebrows a littleit is probably false but it may be true  if it is defarge began and stopped  if it is repeated his wife  and if it does come while we live to see it triumph i hopefor her sake destiny will keep her husband out of france  her husbands destiny said madame defarge with her usualcomposure will take him where he is to go and will lead him tothe end that is to end him that is all i know  but it is very strange now at least is it not very strangesaid defarge rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit itthat after all our sympathy for monsieur her father and herselfher husbands name should be proscribed under your hand at thismoment by the side of that infernal dogs who has just left us  stranger things than that will happen when it does comeanswered madame i have them both here of a certainty and theyare both here for their merits that is enough  she rolled up her knitting when she had said those words andpresently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound abouther head either saint antoine had an instinctive sense that theobjectionable decoration was gone or saint antoine was on the watchfor its disappearance howbeit the saint took courage to lounge invery shortly afterwards and the wineshop recovered its habitualaspect  in the evening at which season of all others saint antoine turnedhimself inside out and sat on doorsteps and windowledges andcame to the corners of vile streets and courts for a breath of airmadame defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass fromplace to place and from group to group a missionary there weremany like her such as the world will do well never to breed againall the women knitted they knitted worthless things but themechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinkingthe hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus if thebony fingers had been still the stomachs would have been morefaminepinched  but as the fingers went the eyes went and the thoughts and asmadame defarge moved on from group to group all three went quickerand fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken withand left behind  her husband smoked at his door looking after her with admirationa great woman said he a strong woman a grand woman afrightfully grand woman  darkness closed around and then came the ringing of church bellsand the distant beating of the military drums in the palace courtyardas the women sat knitting knitting darkness encompassed themanother darkness was closing in as surely when the church bells thenringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over france should bemelted into thundering cannon when the military drums should bebeating to drown a wretched voice that night all potent as thevoice of power and plenty freedom and life so much was closing inabout the women who sat knitting knitting they their very selveswere closing in around a structure yet unbuilt where they were to sitknitting knitting dropping heads  xvii  one night  never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quietcorner in soho than one memorable evening when the doctor and hisdaughter sat under the planetree together never did the moon risewith a milder radiance over great london than on that night when itfound them still seated under the tree and shone upon their facesthrough its leaves  lucie was to be married tomorrow she had reserved this lastevening for her father and they sat alone under the planetree  you are happy my dear father  quite my child  they had said little though they had been there a long time whenit was yet light enough to work and read she had neither engagedherself in her usual work nor had she read to him she had employedherself in both ways at his side under the tree many and many atime but this time was not quite like any other and nothing couldmake it so  and i am very happy tonight dear father i am deeply happy in thelove that heaven has so blessed my love for charles and charlesslove for me but if my life were not to be still consecrated toyou or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us evenby the length of a few of these streets i should be more unhappyand selfreproachful now than i can tell you even as it is  even as it was she could not command her voice  in the sad moonlight she clasped him by the neck and laid her faceupon his breast in the moonlight which is always sad as the light ofthe sun itself is as the light called human life is at its comingand its going  dearest dear can you tell me this last time that you feel quitequite sure no new affections of mine and no new duties of mine willever interpose between us i know it well but do you know it in yourown heart do you feel quite certain  her father answered with a cheerful firmness of conviction he couldscarcely have assumed quite sure my darling more than that headded as he tenderly kissed her my future is far brighter lucieseen through your marriage than it could have been nay than it everwas without it  if i could hope that my father  believe it love indeed it is so consider how natural and howplain it is my dear that it should be so you devoted and youngcannot fully appreciate the anxiety i have felt that your lifeshould not be wasted  she moved her hand towards his lips but he took it in his andrepeated the word  wasted my child should not be wasted struck aside from thenatural order of things for my sake your unselfishness cannotentirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this but only askyourself how could my happiness be perfect while yours wasincomplete  if i had never seen charles my father i should have been quitehappy with you  he smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have beenunhappy without charles having seen him and replied  my child you did see him and it is charles if it had not beencharles it would have been another or if it had been no other ishould have been the cause and then the dark part of my life wouldhave cast its shadow beyond myself and would have fallen on you  it was the first time except at the trial of her ever hearinghim refer to the period of his suffering it gave her a strange andnew sensation while his words were in her ears and she rememberedit long afterwards  see said the doctor of beauvais raising his hand towards themoon i have looked at her from my prisonwindow when i could notbear her fight i have looked at her when it has been such tortureto me to think of her shining upon what i had lost that i have beatenmy head against my prisonwalls i have looked at her in a state sodull and lethargic that i have thought of nothing but the number ofhorizontal lines i could draw across her at the full and the numberof perpendicular lines with which i could intersect them he added inhis inward and pondering manner as he looked at the moon it wastwenty either way i remember and the twentieth was difficult tosqueeze in  the strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that timedeepened as he dwelt upon it but there was nothing to shock her inthe manner of his reference he only seemed to contrast his presentcheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over  i have looked at her speculating thousands of times upon theunborn child from whom i had been rent whether it was alivewhether it had been born alive or the poor mothers shock hadkilled it whether it was a son who would some day avenge hisfather there was a time in my imprisonment when my desire forvengeance was unbearable whether it was a son who would never knowhis fathers story who might even live to weigh the possibility ofhis fathers having disappeared of his own will and act whether itwas a daughter who would grow to be a woman  she drew closer to him and kissed his cheek and his hand  i have pictured my daughter to myself as perfectly forgetful ofme rather altogether ignorant of me and unconscious of me i havecast up the years of her age year after year i have seen her marriedto a man who knew nothing of my fate i have altogether perishedfrom the remembrance of the living and in the next generation myplace was a blank  my father even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughterwho never existed strikes to my heart as if i had been that child  you lucie it is out of the consolation and restoration you havebrought to me that these remembrances arise and pass between usand the moon on this last night what did i say just now  she knew nothing of you she cared nothing for you  so but on other moonlight nights when the sadness and the silencehave touched me in a different way have affected me with something aslike a sorrowful sense of peace as any emotion that had pain forits foundations could i have imagined her as coming to me in my celland leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress i have seenher image in the moonlight often as i now see you except that inever held her in my arms it stood between the little grated windowand the door but you understand that that not the child i amspeaking of  the figure was not the the image the fancy  no that was another thing it stood before my disturbed sense ofsight but it never moved the phantom that my mind pursued wasanother and more real child of her outward appearance i know nomore than that she was like her mother the other had that likenesstoo as you have but was not the same can you follow me luciehardly i think i doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner tounderstand these perplexed distinctions  his collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood fromrunning cold as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition  in that more peaceful state i have imagined her in the moonlightcoming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her marriedlife was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father my picturewas in her room and i was in her prayers her life was activecheerful useful but my poor history pervaded it all  i was that child my father i was not half so good but in my lovethat was i  and she showed me her children said the doctor of beauvaisand they had heard of me and had been taught to pity me when theypassed a prison of the state they kept far from its frowning wallsand looked up at its bars and spoke in whispers she could neverdeliver me i imagined that she always brought me back after showingme such things but then blessed with the relief of tears i fellupon my knees and blessed her  i am that child i hope my father o my dear my dear will youbless me as fervently tomorrow  lucie i recall these old troubles in the reason that i havetonight for loving you better than words can tell and thanking godfor my great happiness my thoughts when they were wildest neverrose near the happiness that i have known with you and that we havebefore us  he embraced her solemnly commended her to heaven and humblythanked heaven for having bestowed her on him byandbye they wentinto the house  there was no one bidden to the marriage but mr lorry there waseven to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross the marriage was tomake no change in their place of residence they had been able toextend it by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerlybelonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger and they desired nothingmore  doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper they wereonly three at table and miss pross made the third he regrettedthat charles was not there was more than half disposed to object tothe loving little plot that kept him away and drank to himaffectionately  so the time came for him to bid lucie good night and theyseparated but in the stillness of the third hour of the morninglucie came downstairs again and stole into his room not free fromunshaped fears beforehand  all things however were in their places all was quiet and he layasleep his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow and hishands lying quiet on the coverlet she put her needless candle inthe shadow at a distance crept up to his bed and put her lips tohis then leaned over him and looked at him  into his handsome face the bitter waters of captivity had wornbut he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong thathe held the mastery of them even in his sleep a more remarkableface in its quiet resolute and guarded struggle with an unseenassailant was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleepthat night  she timidly laid her hand on his dear breast and put up a prayerthat she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be andas his sorrows deserved then she withdrew her hand and kissed hislips once more and went away so the sunrise came and the shadowsof the leaves of the planetree moved upon his face as softly asher lips had moved in praying for him  xviii  nine days  the marriageday was shining brightly and they were ready outsidethe closed door of the doctors room where he was speaking withcharles darnay they were ready to go to church the beautifulbride mr lorry and miss pross to whom the event through a gradualprocess of reconcilement to the inevitable would have been one ofabsolute bliss but for the yet lingering consideration that herbrother solomon should have been the bridegroom  and so said mr lorry who could not sufficiently admire thebride and who had been moving round her to take in every point of herquiet pretty dress and so it was for this my sweet lucie that ibrought you across the channel such a baby lord bless me how littlei thought what i was doing how lightly i valued the obligation iwas conferring on my friend mr charles  you didnt mean it remarked the matteroffact miss pross andtherefore how could you know it nonsense  really well but dont cry said the gentle mr lorry  i am not crying said miss pross you are  i my pross by this time mr lorry dared to be pleasant withher on occasion  you were just now i saw you do it and i dont wonder at it sucha present of plate as you have made em is enough to bring tears intoanybodys eyes theres not a fork or a spoon in the collection saidmiss pross that i didnt cry over last night after the box cametill i couldnt see it  i am highly gratified said mr lorry though upon my honouri had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembranceinvisible to any one dear me this is an occasion that makes a manspeculate on all he has lost dear dear dear to think that theremight have been a mrs lorry any time these fifty years almost  not at all from miss pross  you think there never might have been a mrs lorry asked thegentleman of that name  pooh rejoined miss pross you were a bachelor in your cradle  well observed mr lorry beamingly adjusting his little wigthat seems probable too  and you were cut out for a bachelor pursued miss pross beforeyou were put in your cradle  then i think said mr lorry that i was very unhandsomely dealtwith and that i ought to have had a voice in the selection of mypattern enough now my dear lucie drawing his arm soothingly roundher waist i hear them moving in the next room and miss pross and ias two formal folks of business are anxious not to lose the finalopportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear youleave your good father my dear in hands as earnest and as lovingas your own he shall be taken every conceivable care of during thenext fortnight while you are in warwickshire and thereabouts eventellsons shall go to the wall comparatively speaking before himand when at the fortnights end he comes to join you and yourbeloved husband on your other fortnights trip in wales you shallsay that we have sent him to you in the best health and in thehappiest frame now i hear somebodys step coming to the door let mekiss my dear girl with an oldfashioned bachelor blessing beforesomebody comes to claim his own  for a moment he held the fair face from him to look at thewellremembered expression on the forehead and then laid the brightgolden hair against his little brown wig with a genuine tendernessand delicacy which if such things be oldfashioned were as old asadam  the door of the doctors room opened and he came out with charlesdarnay he was so deadly pale which had not been the case when theywent in together that no vestige of colour was to be seen in hisface but in the composure of his manner he was unaltered exceptthat to the shrewd glance of mr lorry it disclosed some shadowyindication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passedover him like a cold wind  he gave his arm to his daughter and took her downstairs to thechariot which mr lorry had hired in honour of the day the restfollowed in another carriage and soon in a neighbouring churchwhere no strange eyes looked on charles darnay and lucie manette werehappily married  besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the littlegroup when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparklingglanced on the brides hand which were newly released from the darkobscurity of one of mr lorrys pockets they returned home tobreakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair thathad mingled with the poor shoemakers white locks in the paris garretwere mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the thresholdof the door at parting  it was a hard parting though it was not for long but her fathercheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from herenfolding arms take her charles she is yours  and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and shewas gone  the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and thepreparations having been very simple and few the doctor mr lorryand miss pross were left quite alone it was when they turned intothe welcome shade of the cool old hall that mr lorry observed agreat change to have come over the doctor as if the golden armuplifted there had struck him a poisoned blow  he had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might havebeen expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone butit was the old scared lost look that troubled mr lorry and throughhis absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering awayinto his own room when they got upstairs mr lorry was reminded ofdefarge the wineshop keeper and the starlight ride  i think he whispered to miss pross after anxiousconsideration i think we had best not speak to him just now or atall disturb him i must look in at tellsons so i will go there atonce and come back presently then we will take him a ride into thecountry and dine there and all will be well  it was easier for mr lorry to look in at tellsons than to lookout of tellsons he was detained two hours when he came back heascended the old staircase alone having asked no question of theservant going thus into the doctors rooms he was stopped by a lowsound of knocking  good god he said with a start whats that  miss pross with a terrified face was at his ear o me o meall is lost cried she wringing her hands what is to be told toladybird he doesnt know me and is making shoes  mr lorry said what he could to calm her and went himself intothe doctors room the bench was turned towards the light as it hadbeen when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before and his headwas bent down and he was very busy  doctor manette my dear friend doctor manette  the doctor looked at him for a moment half inquiringly half asif he were angry at being spoken to and bent over his work again  he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat his shirt was open atthe throat as it used to be when he did that work and even the oldhaggard faded surface of face had come back to him he worked hardimpatiently as if in some sense of having been interrupted  mr lorry glanced at the work in his hand and observed that itwas a shoe of the old size and shape he took up another that waslying by him and asked what it was  a young ladys walking shoe he muttered without looking upit ought to have been finished long ago let it be  but doctor manette look at me  he obeyed in the old mechanically submissive manner withoutpausing in his work  you know me my dear friend think again this is not your properoccupation think dear friend  nothing would induce him to speak more he looked up for an instantat a time when he was requested to do so but no persuasion wouldextract a word from him he worked and worked and worked insilence and words fell on him as they would have fallen on anecholess wall or on the air the only ray of hope that mr lorrycould discover was that he sometimes furtively looked up withoutbeing asked in that there seemed a faint expression of curiosityor perplexity as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts inhis mind  two things at once impressed themselves on mr lorry as importantabove all others the first that this must be kept secret from luciethe second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him inconjunction with miss pross he took immediate steps towards thelatter precaution by giving out that the doctor was not well andrequired a few days of complete rest in aid of the kind deceptionto be practised on his daughter miss pross was to write describinghis having been called away professionally and referring to animaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own handrepresented to have been addressed to her by the same post  these measures advisable to be taken in any case mr lorry took inthe hope of his coming to himself if that should happen soon he keptanother course in reserve which was to have a certain opinion thathe thought the best on the doctors case  in the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third coursebeing thereby rendered practicable mr lorry resolved to watch himattentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so hetherefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellsons for thefirst time in his life and took his post by the window in the sameroom  he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless tospeak to him since on being pressed he became worried he abandonedthat attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himselfalways before him as a silent protest against the delusion into whichhe had fallen or was falling he remained therefore in his seatnear the window reading and writing and expressing in as manypleasant and natural ways as he could think of that it was a freeplace  doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink andworked on that first day until it was too dark to see worked onhalf an hour after mr lorry could not have seen for his life toread or write when he put his tools aside as useless untilmorning mr lorry rose and said to him  will you go out  he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old mannerlooked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice  out  yes for a walk with me why not  he made no effort to say why not and said not a word more but mrlorry thought he saw as he leaned forward on his bench in the duskwith his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was insome misty way asking himself why not the sagacity of the man ofbusiness perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it  miss pross and he divided the night into two watches and observedhim at intervals from the adjoining room he paced up and down for along time before he lay down but when he did finally lay himselfdown he fell asleep in the morning he was up betimes and wentstraight to his bench and to work  on this second day mr lorry saluted him cheerfully by his nameand spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to themhe returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what wassaid and that he thought about it however confusedly thisencouraged mr lorry to have miss pross in with her work severaltimes during the day at those times they quietly spoke of lucie andof her father then present precisely in the usual manner and as ifthere were nothing amiss this was done without any demonstrativeaccompaniment not long enough or often enough to harass him andit lightened mr lorrys friendly heart to believe that he looked upoftener and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception ofinconsistencies surrounding him  when it fell dark again mr lorry asked him as before  dear doctor will you go out  as before he repeated out  yes for a walk with me why not  this time mr lorry feigned to go out when he could extract noanswer from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned inthe meanwhile the doctor had removed to the seat in the window andhad sat there looking down at the planetree but on mr lorrysreturn he slipped away to his bench  the time went very slowly on and mr lorrys hope darkened and hisheart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier everyday the third day came and went the fourth the fifth five dayssix days seven days eight days nine days  with a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growingheavier and heavier mr lorry passed through this anxious time thesecret was well kept and lucie was unconscious and happy but hecould not fail to observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been alittle out at first was growing dreadfully skilful and that he hadnever been so intent on his work and that his hands had never been sonimble and expert as in the dusk of the ninth evening  xix  an opinion  worn out by anxious watching mr lorry fell asleep at his poston the tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shiningof the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken himwhen it was dark night  he rubbed his eyes and roused himself but he doubted when he haddone so whether he was not still asleep for going to the door ofthe doctors room and looking in he perceived that the shoemakersbench and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himselfsat reading at the window he was in his usual morning dress andhis face which mr lorry could distinctly see though still verypale was calmly studious and attentive  even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake mr lorry feltgiddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemakingmight not be a disturbed dream of his own for did not his eyesshow him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing andaspect and employed as usual and was there any sign within theirrange that the change of which he had so strong an impression hadactually happened  it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishmentthe answer being obvious if the impression were not produced by areal corresponding and sufficient cause how came he jarvis lorrythere how came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on thesofa in doctor manettes consultingroom and to be debating thesepoints outside the doctors bedroom door in the early morning  within a few minutes miss pross stood whispering at his side if hehad had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity haveresolved it but he was by that time clearheaded and had none headvised that they should let the time go by until the regularbreakfasthour and should then meet the doctor as if nothingunusual had occurred if he appeared to be in his customary state ofmind mr lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction andguidance from the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious toobtain  miss pross submitting herself to his judgment the scheme wasworked out with care having abundance of time for his usualmethodical toilette mr lorry presented himself at the breakfasthourin his usual white linen and with his usual neat leg the doctorwas summoned in the usual way and came to breakfast  so far as it was possible to comprehend him without over steppingthose delicate and gradual approaches which mr lorry felt to be theonly safe advance he at first supposed that his daughters marriagehad taken place yesterday an incidental allusion purposely thrownout to the day of the week and the day of the month set himthinking and counting and evidently made him uneasy in all otherrespects however he was so composedly himself that mr lorrydetermined to have the aid he sought and that aid was his own  therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and heand the doctor were left together mr lorry said feelingly  my dear manette i am anxious to have your opinion inconfidence on a very curious case in which i am deeply interestedthat is to say it is very curious to me perhaps to your betterinformation it may be less so  glancing at his hands which were discoloured by his late workthe doctor looked troubled and listened attentively he had alreadyglanced at his hands more than once  doctor manette said mr lorry touching him affectionately on thearm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine praygive your mind to it and advise me well for his sake and aboveall for his daughters his daughters my dear manette  if i understand said the doctor in a subdued tone somemental shock  yes  be explicit said the doctor spare no detail  mr lorry saw that they understood one another and proceeded  my dear manette it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock ofgreat acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings thethe as you express it the mind the mind it is the case of ashock under which the sufferer was borne down one cannot say forhow long because i believe he cannot calculate the time himselfand there are no other means of getting at it it is the case of ashock from which the sufferer recovered by a process that he cannottrace himself as i once heard him publicly relate in a strikingmanner it is the case of a shock from which he has recovered socompletely as to be a highly intelligent man capable of closeapplication of mind and great exertion of body and of constantlymaking fresh additions to his stock of knowledge which was alreadyvery large but unfortunately there has been he paused and tooka deep breath a slight relapse  the doctor in a low voice asked of how long duration  nine days and nights  how did it show itself i infer glancing at his hands againin the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock  that is the fact  now did you ever see him asked the doctor distinctly andcollectedly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuitoriginally  once  and when the relapse fell on him was he in most respects or inall respects as he was then  i think in all respects  you spoke of his daughter does his daughter know of the relapse  no it has been kept from her and i hope will always be keptfrom her it is known only to myself and to one other who may betrusted  the doctor grasped his hand and murmured that was very kind thatwas very thoughtful mr lorry grasped his hand in return andneither of the two spoke for a little while  now my dear manette said mr lorry at length in his mostconsiderate and most affectionate way i am a mere man of businessand unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters i donot possess the kind of information necessary i do not possess thekind of intelligence i want guiding there is no man in this world onwhom i could so rely for right guidance as on you tell me howdoes this relapse come about is there danger of another could arepetition of it be prevented how should a repetition of it betreated how does it come about at all what can i do for my friendno man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve afriend than i am to serve mine if i knew how but i dont know howto originate in such a case if your sagacity knowledge andexperience could put me on the right track i might be able to doso much unenlightened and undirected i can do so little praydiscuss it with me pray enable me to see it a little more clearlyand teach me how to be a little more useful  doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spokenand mr lorry did not press him  i think it probable said the doctor breaking silence with aneffort that the relapse you have described my dear friend wasnot quite unforeseen by its subject  was it dreaded by him mr lorry ventured to ask  very much he said it with an involuntary shudder  you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on thesufferers mind and how difficult how almost impossible it isfor him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresseshim  would he asked mr lorry be sensibly relieved if he couldprevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one whenit is on him  i think so but it is as i have told you next to impossible ieven believe it in some cases to be quite impossible  now said mr lorry gently laying his hand on the doctors armagain after a short silence on both sides to what would you referthis attack  i believe returned doctor manette that there had been astrong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought andremembrance that was the first cause of the malady some intenseassociations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled ithink it is probable that there had long been a dread lurking inhis mind that those associations would be recalled say undercertain circumstances say on a particular occasion he tried toprepare himself in vain perhaps the effort to prepare himself madehim less able to bear it  would he remember what took place in the relapse asked mr lorrywith natural hesitation  the doctor looked desolately round the room shook his head andanswered in a low voice not at all  now as to the future hinted mr lorry  as to the future said the doctor recovering firmness ishould have great hope as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restorehim so soon i should have great hope he yielding under the pressureof a complicated something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen andcontended against and recovering after the cloud had burst andpassed i should hope that the worst was over  well well thats good comfort i am thankful said mr lorry  i am thankful repeated the doctor bending his head withreverence  there are two other points said mr lorry on which i am anxiousto be instructed i may go on  you cannot do your friend a better service the doctor gave himhis hand  to the first then he is of a studious habit and unusuallyenergetic he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisitionof professional knowledge to the conducting of experiments to manythings now does he do too much  i think not it may be the character of his mind to be always insingular need of occupation that may be in part natural to it inpart the result of affliction the less it was occupied withhealthy things the more it would be in danger of turning in theunhealthy direction he may have observed himself and made thediscovery  you are sure that he is not under too great a strain  i think i am quite sure of it  my dear manette if he were overworked now  my dear lorry i doubt if that could easily be there has been aviolent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight  excuse me as a persistent man of business assuming for amoment that he was overworked it would show itself in some renewalof this disorder  i do not think so i do not think said doctor manette with thefirmness of selfconviction that anything but the one train ofassociation would renew it i think that henceforth nothing but someextraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it after what hashappened and after his recovery i find it difficult to imagine anysuch violent sounding of that string again i trust and i almostbelieve that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted  he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thingwould overset the delicate organisation of the mind and yet withthe confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out ofpersonal endurance and distress it was not for his friend to abatethat confidence he professed himself more relieved and encouragedthan he really was and approached his second and last point hefelt it to be the most difficult of all but remembering his oldsunday morning conversation with miss pross and remembering what hehad seen in the last nine days he knew that he must face it  the occupation resumed under the influence of this passingaffection so happily recovered from said mr lorry clearing histhroat we will call blacksmiths work blacksmiths work we willsay to put a case and for the sake of illustration that he hadbeen used in his bad time to work at a little forge we will saythat he was unexpectedly found at his forge again is it not a pitythat he should keep it by him  the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and beat his footnervously on the ground  he has always kept it by him said mr lorry with an anxious lookat his friend now would it not be better that he should let it go  still the doctor with shaded forehead beat his foot nervouslyon the ground  you do not find it easy to advise me said mr lorry i quiteunderstand it to be a nice question and yet i think and there heshook his head and stopped  you see said doctor manette turning to him after an uneasypause it is very hard to explain consistently the innermostworkings of this poor mans mind he once yearned so frightfully forthat occupation and it was so welcome when it came no doubt itrelieved his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of thefingers for the perplexity of the brain and by substituting as hebecame more practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuityof the mental torture that he has never been able to bear the thoughtof putting it quite out of his reach even now when i believe he ismore hopeful of himself than he has ever been and even speaks ofhimself with a kind of confidence the idea that he might need thatold employment and not find it gives him a sudden sense of terrorlike that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child  he looked like his illustration as he raised his eyes to mrlorrys face  but may not mind i ask for information a plodding man ofbusiness who only deals with such material objects guineas shillingsand banknotes may not the retention of the thing involve theretention of the idea if the thing were gone my dear manettemight not the fear go with it in short is it not a concession to themisgiving to keep the forge  there was another silence  you see too said the doctor tremulously it is such an oldcompanion  i would not keep it said mr lorry shaking his head for hegained in firmness as he saw the doctor disquieted i would recommendhim to sacrifice it i only want your authority i am sure it doesno good come give me your authority like a dear good man for hisdaughters sake my dear manette  very strange to see what a struggle there was within him  in her name then let it be done i sanction it but i wouldnot take it away while he was present let it be removed when he isnot there let him miss his old companion after an absence  mr lorry readily engaged for that and the conference was endedthey passed the day in the country and the doctor was quite restoredon the three following days he remained perfectly well and on thefourteenth day he went away to join lucie and her husband theprecaution that had been taken to account for his silence mr lorryhad previously explained to him and he had written to lucie inaccordance with it and she had no suspicions  on the night of the day on which he left the house mr lorry wentinto his room with a chopper saw chisel and hammer attended bymiss pross carrying a light there with closed doors and in amysterious and guilty manner mr lorry hacked the shoemakers benchto pieces while miss pross held the candle as if she were assistingat a murder for which indeed in her grimness she was nounsuitable figure the burning of the body previously reduced topieces convenient for the purpose was commenced without delay inthe kitchen fire and the tools shoes and leather were buried inthe garden so wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honestminds that mr lorry and miss pross while engaged in thecommission of their deed and in the removal of its traces almostfelt and almost looked like accomplices in a horrible crime  xx  a plea  when the newlymarried pair came home the first person whoappeared to offer his congratulations was sydney carton they hadnot been at home many hours when he presented himself he was notimproved in habits or in looks or in manner but there was a certainrugged air of fidelity about him which was new to the observationof charles darnay  he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window andof speaking to him when no one overheard  mr darnay said carton i wish we might be friends  we are already friends i hope  you are good enough to say so as a fashion of speech but i dontmean any fashion of speech indeed when i say i wish we might befriends i scarcely mean quite that either  charles darnay as was natural asked him in all goodhumour andgoodfellowship what he did mean  upon my life said carton smiling i find that easier tocomprehend in my own mind than to convey to yours however let metry you remember a certain famous occasion when i was more drunkthan than usual  i remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me toconfess that you had been drinking  i remember it too the curse of those occasions is heavy upon mefor i always remember them i hope it may be taken into account oneday when all days are at an end for me dont be alarmed i am notgoing to preach  i am not at all alarmed earnestness in you is anything butalarming to me  ah said carton with a careless wave of his hand as if hewaved that away on the drunken occasion in question one of alarge number as you know i was insufferable about liking you andnot liking you i wish you would forget it  i forgot it long ago  fashion of speech again but mr darnay oblivion is not so easyto me as you represent it to be to you i have by no meansforgotten it and a light answer does not help me to forget it  if it was a light answer returned darnay i beg your forgivenessfor it i had no other object than to turn a slight thing which tomy surprise seems to trouble you too much aside i declare to youon the faith of a gentleman that i have long dismissed it from mymind good heaven what was there to dismiss have i had nothingmore important to remember in the great service you rendered methat day  as to the great service said carton i am bound to avow toyou when you speak of it in that way that it was mere professionalclaptrap i dont know that i cared what became of you when irendered it mind i say when i rendered it i am speaking of thepast  you make light of the obligation returned darnay but i will notquarrel with your light answer  genuine truth mr darnay trust me i have gone aside from mypurpose i was speaking about our being friends now you know me youknow i am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men ifyou doubt it ask stryver and hell tell you so  i prefer to form my own opinion without the aid of his  well at any rate you know me as a dissolute dog who has neverdone any good and never will  i dont know that you never will  but i do and you must take my word for it well if you couldendure to have such a worthless fellow and a fellow of suchindifferent reputation coming and going at odd times i should askthat i might be permitted to come and go as a privileged personhere that i might be regarded as an useless and i would add if itwere not for the resemblance i detected between you and me anunornamental piece of furniture tolerated for its old service andtaken no notice of i doubt if i should abuse the permission it isa hundred to one if i should avail myself of it four times in ayear it would satisfy me i dare say to know that i had it  will you try  that is another way of saying that i am placed on the footing ihave indicated i thank you darnay i may use that freedom withyour name  i think so carton by this time  they shook hands upon it and sydney turned away within a minuteafterwards he was to all outward appearance as unsubstantial asever  when he was gone and in the course of an evening passed with misspross the doctor and mr lorry charles darnay made some mentionof this conversation in general terms and spoke of sydney carton as aproblem of carelessness and recklessness he spoke of him in shortnot bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him but as anybody mightwho saw him as he showed himself  he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fairyoung wife but when he afterwards joined her in their own roomshe found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of theforehead strongly marked  we are thoughtful tonight said darnay drawing his arm abouther  yes dearest charles with her hands on his breast and theinquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him we are ratherthoughtful tonight for we have something on our mind tonight  what is it my lucie  will you promise not to press one question on me if i beg younot to ask it  will i promise what will i not promise to my love  what indeed with his hand putting aside the golden hair from thecheek and his other hand against the heart that beat for him  i think charles poor mr carton deserves more consideration andrespect than you expressed for him tonight  indeed my own why so  that is what you are not to ask me but i think i know he does  if you know it it is enough what would you have me do my life  i would ask you dearest to be very generous with him alwaysand very lenient on his faults when he is not by i would ask you tobelieve that he has a heart he very very seldom reveals and thatthere are deep wounds in it my dear i have seen it bleeding  it is a painful reflection to me said charles darnay quiteastounded that i should have done him any wrong i never thoughtthis of him  my husband it is so i fear he is not to be reclaimed there isscarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes isreparable now but i am sure that he is capable of good thingsgentle things even magnanimous things  she looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost manthat her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours  and o my dearest love she urged clinging nearer to himlaying her head upon his breast and raising her eyes to hisremember how strong we are in our happiness and how weak he is inhis misery  the supplication touched him home i will always remember itdear heart i will remember it as long as i live  he bent over the golden head and put the rosy lips to his andfolded her in his arms if one forlorn wanderer then pacing the darkstreets could have heard her innocent disclosure and could have seenthe drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyesso loving of that husband he might have cried to the night and thewords would not have parted from his lips for the first time  god bless her for her sweet compassion  xxi  echoing footsteps  a wonderful corner for echoes it has been remarked that cornerwhere the doctor lived ever busily winding the golden thread whichbound her husband and her father and herself and her old directressand companion in a life of quiet bliss lucie sat in the stillhouse in the tranquilly resounding corner listening to the echoingfootsteps of years  at first there were times though she was a perfectly happy youngwife when her work would slowly fall from her hands and her eyeswould be dimmed for there was something coming in the echoessomething light afar off and scarcely audible yet that stirredher heart too much fluttering hopes and doubts hopes of a love asyet unknown to her doubts of her remaining upon earth to enjoy thatnew delightdivided her breast among the echoes then there wouldarise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave and thoughts ofthe husband who would be left so desolate and who would mourn for herso much swelled to her eyes and broke like waves  that time passed and her little lucie lay on her bosom then amongthe advancing echoes there was the tread of her tiny feet and thesound of her prattling words let greater echoes resound as theywould the young mother at the cradle side could always hear thosecoming they came and the shady house was sunny with a childs laughand the divine friend of children to whom in her trouble she hadconfided hers seemed to take her child in his arms as he took thechild of old and made it a sacred joy to her  ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them alltogether weaving the service of her happy influence through thetissue of all their lives and making it predominate nowhere lucieheard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing soundsher husbands step was strong and prosperous among them herfathers firm and equal lo miss pross in harness of stringawakening the echoes as an unruly charger whipcorrected snortingand pawing the earth under the planetree in the garden  even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest they werenot harsh nor cruel even when golden hair like her own lay in ahalo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy and he saidwith a radiant smile dear papa and mamma i am very sorry to leaveyou both and to leave my pretty sister but i am called and i mustgo those were not tears all of agony that wetted his youngmothers cheek as the spirit departed from her embrace that hadbeen entrusted to it suffer them and forbid them not they see myfathers face o father blessed words  thus the rustling of an angels wings got blended with the otherechoes and they were not wholly of earth but had in them that breathof heaven sighs of the winds that blew over a little gardentomb weremingled with them also and both were audible to lucie in a hushedmurmurlike the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shoreas the little lucie comically studious at the task of the morning ordressing a doll at her mothers footstool chattered in the tongues ofthe two cities that were blended in her life  the echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of sydney cartonsome halfdozen times a year at most he claimed his privilege ofcoming in uninvited and would sit among them through the eveningas he had once done often he never came there heated with wine andone other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes which hasbeen whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages  no man ever really loved a woman lost her and knew her with ablameless though an unchanged mind when she was a wife and amother but her children had a strange sympathy with him aninstinctive delicacy of pity for him what fine hidden sensibilitiesare touched in such a case no echoes tell but it is so and it wasso here carton was the first stranger to whom little lucie held outher chubby arms and he kept his place with her as she grew thelittle boy had spoken of him almost at the last poor carton kisshim for me  mr stryver shouldered his way through the law like some greatengine forcing itself through turbid water and dragged his usefulfriend in his wake like a boat towed astern as the boat sofavoured is usually in a rough plight and mostly under water sosydney had a swamped life of it but easy and strong customunhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulatingsense of desert or disgrace made it the life he was to lead and heno more thought of emerging from his state of lions jackal thanany real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lionstryver was rich had married a florid widow with property and threeboys who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straighthair of their dumpling heads  these three young gentlemen mr stryver exuding patronage of themost offensive quality from every pore had walked before him likethree sheep to the quiet corner in soho and had offered as pupilsto lucies husband delicately saying halloa here are three lumps ofbreadandcheese towards your matrimonial picnic darnay thepolite rejection of the three lumps of breadandcheese had quitebloated mr stryver with indignation which he afterwards turned toaccount in the training of the young gentlemen by directing them tobeware of the pride of beggars like that tutorfellow he was also inthe habit of declaiming to mrs stryver over his fullbodied wine onthe arts mrs darnay had once put in practice to catch him and onthe diamondcutdiamond arts in himself madam which had rendered himnot to be caught some of his kings bench familiars who wereoccasionally parties to the fullbodied wine and the lie excusedhim for the latter by saying that he had told it so often that hebelieved it himself which is surely such an incorrigibleaggravation of an originally bad offence as to justify any suchoffenders being carried off to some suitably retired spot andthere hanged out of the way  these were among the echoes to which lucie sometimes pensivesometimes amused and laughing listened in the echoing corner untilher little daughter was six years old how near to her heart theechoes of her childs tread came and those of her own dearfathers always active and selfpossessed and those of her dearhusbands need not be told nor how the lightest echo of theirunited home directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thriftthat it was more abundant than any waste was music to her nor howthere were echoes all about her sweet in her ears of the manytimes her father had told her that he found her more devoted to himmarried if that could be than single and of the many times herhusband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divideher love for him or her help to him and asked her what is themagic secret my darling of your being everything to all of us as ifthere were only one of us yet never seeming to be hurried or to havetoo much to do  but there were other echoes from a distance that rumbledmenacingly in the corner all through this space of time and it wasnow about little lucies sixth birthday that they began to have anawful sound as of a great storm in france with a dreadful sea rising  on a night in midjuly one thousand seven hundred andeightynine mr lorry came in late from tellsons and sat himselfdown by lucie and her husband in the dark window it was a hot wildnight and they were all three reminded of the old sunday night whenthey had looked at the lightning from the same place  i began to think said mr lorry pushing his brown wig backthat i should have to pass the night at tellsons we have been sofun of business all day that we have not known what to do first orwhich way to turn there is such an uneasiness in paris that wehave actually a run of confidence upon us our customers over thereseem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough thereis positively a mania among some of them for sending it to england  that has a bad look said darnay  a bad look you say my dear darnay yes but we dont know whatreason there is in it people are so unreasonable some of us attellsons are getting old and we really cant be troubled out ofthe ordinary course without due occasion  stiff said darnay you know how gloomy and threatening the skyis  i know that to be sure assented mr lorry trying to persuadehimself that his sweet temper was soured and that he grumbled but iam determined to be peevish after my long days botheration whereis manette  here he is said the doctor entering the dark room at the moment  i am quite glad you are at home for these hurries andforebodings by which i have been surrounded all day long have made menervous without reason you are not going out i hope  no i am going to play backgammon with you if you like saidthe doctor  i dont think i do like if i may speak my mind i am not fit to bepitted against you tonight is the teaboard still there lucie icant see  of course it has been kept for you  thank ye my dear the precious child is safe in bed  and sleeping soundly  thats right all safe and well i dont know why anything shouldbe otherwise than safe and well here thank god but i have been soput out all day and i am not as young as i was my tea my dearthank ye now come and take your place in the circle and let ussit quiet and hear the echoes about which you have your theory  not a theory it was a fancy  a fancy then my wise pet said mr lorry patting her handthey are very numerous and very loud though are they not only hearthem  headlong mad and dangerous footsteps to force their way intoanybodys life footsteps not easily made clean again if oncestained red the footsteps raging in saint antoine afar off as thelittle circle sat in the dark london window  saint antoine had been that morning a vast dusky mass ofscarecrows heaving to and fro with frequent gleams of light above thebillowy heads where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun atremendous roar arose from the throat of saint antoine and a forestof naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of treesin a winter wind all the fingers convulsively clutching at everyweapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depthsbelow no matter how far off  who gave them out whence they last came where they beganthrough what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked scores at atime over the heads of the crowd like a kind of lightning no eye inthe throng could have told but muskets were being distributed sowere cartridges powder and ball bars of iron and wood knivesaxes pikes every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discoveror devise people who could lay hold of nothing else set themselveswith bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of

close together during this briefdiscourse and it had been as much as they could do to hear oneanother even then so tremendous was the noise of the living oceanin its irruption into the fortress and its inundation of the courtsand passages and staircases all around outside too it beat thewalls with a deep hoarse roar from which occasionally some partialshouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray  through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone pasthideous doors of dark dens and cages down cavernous flights of stepsand again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick more like drywaterfalls than staircases defarge the turnkey and jacques threelinked hand and arm went with all the speed they could make here andthere especially at first the inundation started on them and sweptby but when they had done descending and were winding and climbingup a tower they were alone hemmed in here by the massive thicknessof walls and arches the storm within the fortress and without wasonly audible to them in a dull subdued way as if the noise out ofwhich they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing  the turnkey stopped at a low door put a key in a clashing lockswung the door slowly open and said as they all bent their heads andpassed in  one hundred and five north tower  there was a small heavilygrated unglazed window high in the wallwith a stone screen before it so that the sky could be only seen bystooping low and looking up there was a small chimney heavily barredacross a few feet within there was a heap of old feathery woodasheson

few minutessome mortar and dust came dropping down which he averted his faceto avoid and in it and in the old woodashes and in a crevice inthe chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought

were yet unknown the remorseless sea of turbulentlyswaying shapes voices of vengeance and faces hardened in thefurnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark onthem  but in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expressionwas in vivid life there were two groups of faces each seven innumber so fixedly contrasting with the rest that never did searoll which bore more

and congratulations whenmadame defarge sat at her counter as usual presiding over thecustomers madame defarge wore no rose in her head for the greatbrotherhood of spies had become even in one short week extremelychary of trusting themselves to the saints mercies the lampsacross his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them  madame defarge with her arms folded sat in the morning light andheat contemplating the wineshop and the street in both therewere several knots of loungers squalid and miserable but now witha manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress the raggedestnightcap awry on the wretchedest head had this crookedsignificance in it i know how hard it has grown for me the wearerof this to support life in myself but do you know how easy it hasgrown for me the wearer of this to destroy life in you everylean bare arm that had been without work before had this work alwaysready for it now that it could strike the fingers of the knittingwomen were vicious with the experience that they could tear therewas a change in the appearance of saint antoine the image had beenhammering into this for hundreds of years and the last finishingblows had told mightily on the expression  madame defarge sat observing it with such suppressed approval aswas to be desired in the leader of the saint antoine women one of hersisterhood knitted beside her the short rather plump wife of astarved grocer and the mother of two children withal this lieutenanthad already earned the complimentary name of the vengeance  hark said the vengeance listen then who comes  as if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of saintantoine quarter to the wineshop door had been suddenly fired afastspreading murmur came rushing along  it is defarge said madame silence patriots  defarge came in breathless pulled off a red cap he wore and lookedaround him listen everywhere said madame again listen to himdefarge stood panting against a background of eager eyes and openmouths formed outside the door all those within the wineshop hadsprung to their feet  say then my husband what is it  news from the other world  how then cried madame contemptuously the other world  does everybody here recall old foulon who told the famished peoplethat they might eat grass and who died and went to hell  everybody from all throats  the news is of him he is among us  among us from the universal throat again and dead  not dead he feared us so much and with reason that he causedhimself to be represented as dead and had a grand mockfuneral butthey have found him alive hiding in the country and have brought himin i have seen him but now on his way to the hotel de ville aprisoner i have said that he had reason to fear us say all had hereason  wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten if he hadnever known it yet he would have known it in his heart of hearts ifhe could have heard the answering cry  a moment of profound silence followed defarge and his wife lookedsteadfastly at one another the vengeance stooped and the jar of adrum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter  patriots said defarge in a determined voice are we ready  instantly madame defarges knife was in her girdle the drum wasbeating in the streets as if it and a drummer had flown together bymagic and the vengeance uttering terrific shrieks and flingingher arms about her head like all the forty furies at once was tearingfrom house to house rousing the women  the men were terrible in the bloodyminded anger with which theylooked from windows caught up what arms they had and came pouringdown into the streets but the women were a sight to chill theboldest from such household occupations as their bare povertyyielded from their children from their aged and their sick crouchingon the bare ground famished and naked they ran out with streaminghair urging one another and themselves to madness with thewildest cries and actions villain foulon taken my sister old foulontaken my mother miscreant foulon taken my daughter then a scoreof others ran into the midst of these beating their breaststearing their hair and screaming foulon alive foulon who told thestarving people they might eat grass foulon who told my old fatherthat he might eat grass when i had no bread to give him foulon whotold my baby it might suck grass when these breasts where dry

give us the blood of foulon give us the head of foulon giveus the heart of foulon give us the body and soul of foulon rendfoulon to pieces and dig him into the ground that grass may growfrom him with these cries numbers of the women lashed into blindfrenzy whirled about striking and tearing at their own friends untilthey dropped into a passionate swoon and were only saved by the menbelonging to them from being trampled under foot  nevertheless not a moment was lost not a moment this foulon wasat the hotel de ville and might be loosed never if saint antoineknew his own sufferings insults and wrongs armed men and womenflocked out of the quarter so fast and drew even these last dregsafter them with such a force of suction that within a quarter of anhour there was not a human creature in saint antoines bosom but a fewold crones and the wailing children  no they were all by that time choking the hall of examination wherethis old man ugly and wicked was and overflowing into theadjacent open space and streets the defarges husband and wife thevengeance and jacques three were in the first press and at no greatdistance from him in the hall  see cried madame pointing with her knife see the old villainbound with ropes that was well done to tie a bunch of grass uponhis back ha ha that was well done let him eat it now madameput her knife under her arm and clapped her hands as at a play  the people immediately behind madame defarge explaining the causeof her satisfaction to those behind them and those again explainingto others and those to others the neighbouring streets resoundedwith the clapping of hands similarly during two or three hours ofdrawl and the winnowing of many bushels of words madame defargesfrequent expressions of impatience were taken up with marvellousquickness at a distance the more readily because certain men whohad by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the externalarchitecture to look in from the windows knew madame defarge welland acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside thebuilding  at length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as ofhope or protection directly down upon the old prisoners head thefavour was too much to bear in an instant the barrier of dust andchaff that had stood surprisingly long went to the winds and saintantoine had got him  it was known directly to the furthest confines of the crowddefarge had but sprung over a railing and a table and folded themiserable wretch in a deadly embrace madame defarge had butfollowed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he wastied the vengeance and jacques three were not yet up with them andthe men at the windows had not yet swooped into the hall like birdsof prey from their high perches when the cry seemed to go up allover the city bring him out bring him to the lamp  down and up and head foremost on the steps of the building nowon his knees now on his feet now on his back dragged andstruck at and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that werethrust into his face by hundreds of hands torn bruised pantingbleeding yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy now fullof vehement agony of action with a small clear space about him as thepeople drew one another back that they might see now a log of deadwood drawn through a forest of legs he was hauled to the neareststreet corner where one of the fatal lamps swung and there madamedefarge let him go as a cat might have done to a mouse andsilently and composedly looked at him while they made ready and whilehe besought her the women passionately screeching at him all thetime and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass inhis mouth once he went aloft and the rope broke and they caughthim shrieking twice he went aloft and the rope broke and theycaught him shrieking then the rope was merciful and held him andhis head was soon upon a pike with grass enough in the mouth forall saint antoine to dance at the sight of  nor was this the end of the days bad work for saint antoine soshouted and danced his angry blood up that it boiled again onhearing when the day closed in that the soninlaw of thedespatched another of the peoples enemies and insulters wascoming into paris under a guard five hundred strong in cavalry alonesaint antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper seized himwould have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear fouloncompany set his head and heart on pikes and carried the three spoilsof the day in wolfprocession through the streets  not before dark night did the men and women come back to thechildren wailing and breadless then the miserable bakers shopswere beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy badbread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty theybeguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the dayand achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of raggedpeople shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began toshine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streetsat which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at theirdoors  scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as ofmost other sauce to wretched bread yet human fellowship infused somenourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks ofcheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their fullin the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children andlovers with such a world around them and before them loved andhoped  it was almost morning when defarges wineshop parted with its lastknot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife inhusky tones while fastening the door  at last it is come my dear  eh well returned madame almost  saint antoine slept the defarges slept even the vengeance sleptwith her starved grocer and the drum was at rest the drums wasthe only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had notchanged the vengeance as custodian of the drum could have wakenedhim up and had the same speech out of him as before the bastille fellor old foulon was seized not so with the hoarse tones of the menand women in saint antoines bosom  xxiii  fire rises  there was a change on the village where the fountain fell and wherethe mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones onthe highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to holdhis poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together theprison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore there were soldiersto guard it but not many there were officers to guard thesoldiers but not one of them knew what his men would do beyond thisthat it would probably not be what he was ordered  far and wide lay a rained country yielding nothing butdesolation every green leaf every blade of grass and blade of grainwas as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people everything wasbowed down dejected oppressed and broken habitations fencesdomesticated animals men women children and the soil that borethem all worn out  monseigneur often a most worthy individual gentleman was anational blessing gave a chivalrous tone to things was a politeexample of luxurious and shining life and a great deal more toequal purpose nevertheless monseigneur as a class had somehow orother brought things to this strange that creation designedexpressly for monseigneur should be so soon wrung dry and squeezedout there must be something shortsighted in the eternal arrangementssurely thus it was however and the last drop of blood havingbeen extracted from the flints and the last screw of the rackhaving been turned so often that its purchase crumbled and it nowturned and turned with nothing to bite monseigneur began to runaway from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable  but this was not the change on the village and on many a villagelike it for scores of years gone by monseigneur had squeezed itand wrung it and had seldom graced it with his presence except forthe pleasures of the chase now found in hunting the people nowfound in hunting the beasts for whose preservation monseigneur madeedifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness no the changeconsisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste rather thanin the disappearance of the high caste chiselled and otherwisebeautified and beautifying features of monseigneur  for in these times as the mender of roads worked solitary in thedust not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and todust he must return being for the most part too much occupied inthinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eatif he had it in these times as he raised his eyes from his lonelylabour and viewed the prospect he would see some rough figureapproaching on foot the like of which was once a rarity in thoseparts but was now a frequent presence as it advanced the menderof roads would discern without surprise that it was a shaggyhairedman of almost barbarian aspect tall in wooden shoes that wereclumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads grim rough swartsteeped in the mud and dust of many highways dank with the marshymoisture of many low grounds sprinkled with the thorns and leaves andmoss of many byways through woods  such a man came upon him like a ghost at noon in the july weatheras he sat on his heap of stones under a bank taking such shelter ashe could get from a shower of hail  the man looked at him looked at the village in the hollow at themill and at the prison on the crag when he had identified theseobjects in what benighted mind he had he said in a dialect thatwas just intelligible  how goes it jacques  all well jacques  touch then  they joined hands and the man sat down on the heap of stones  no dinner  nothing but supper now said the mender of roads with a hungryface  it is the fashion growled the man i meet no dinner anywhere  he took out a blackened pipe filled it lighted it with flint andsteel pulled at it until it was in a bright glow then suddenly heldit from him and dropped something into it from between his fingerand thumb that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke  touch then it was the turn of the mender of roads to say itthis time after observing these operations they again joined hands  tonight said the mender of roads  tonight said the man putting the pipe in his mouth  where  here  he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones lookingsilently at one another with the hail driving in between them likea pigmy charge of bayonets until the sky began to clear over thevillage  show me said the traveller then moving to the brow of the hill  see returned the mender of roads with extended finger you godown here and straight through the street and past the fountain  to the devil with all that interrupted the other rolling his eyeover the landscape i go through no streets and past no fountainswell  well about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above thevillage  good when do you cease to work  at sunset  will you wake me before departing i have walked two nightswithout resting let me finish my pipe and i shall sleep like achild will you wake me  surely  the wayfarer smoked his pipe out put it in his breast slippedoff his great wooden shoes and lay down on his back on the heap ofstones he was fast asleep directly  as the roadmender plied his dusty labour and the hailcloudsrolling away revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which wereresponded to by silver gleams upon the landscape the little manwho wore a red cap now in place of his blue one seemed fascinatedby the figure on the heap of stones his eyes were so often turnedtowards it that he used his tools mechanically and one would havesaid to very poor account the bronze face the shaggy black hair andbeard the coarse woollen red cap the rough medley dress of homespunstuff and hairy skins of beasts the powerful frame attenuated byspare living and the sullen and desperate compression of the lipsin sleep inspired the mender of roads with awe the traveller hadtravelled far and his feet were footsore and his ankles chafed andbleeding his great shoes stuffed with leaves and grass had beenheavy to drag over the many long leagues and his clothes werechafed into holes as he himself was into sores stooping downbeside him the roadmender tried to get a peep at secret weapons inhis breast or where not but in vain for he slept with his armscrossed upon him and set as resolutely as his lips fortified townswith their stockades guardhouses gates trenches anddrawbridges seemed to the mender of roads to be so much air asagainst this figure and when he lifted his eyes from it to thehorizon and looked around he saw in his small fancy similarfigures stopped by no obstacle tending to centres all over france  the man slept on indifferent to showers of hail and intervals ofbrightness to sunshine on his face and shadow to the pattering lumpsof dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changedthem until the sun was low in the west and the sky was glowingthen the mender of roads having got his tools together and all thingsready to go down into the village roused him  good said the sleeper rising on his elbow two leagues beyondthe summit of the hill  about  about good  the mender of roads went home with the dust going on before himaccording to the set of the wind and was soon at the fountainsqueezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink andappearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all thevillage when the village had taken its poor supper it did notcreep to bed as it usually did but came out of doors again andremained there a curious contagion of whispering was upon it andalso when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark anothercurious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one directiononly monsieur gabelle chief functionary of the place became uneasywent out on his housetop alone and looked in that direction tooglanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by thefountain below and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys ofthe church that there might be need to ring the tocsin byandbye  the night deepened the trees environing the old chateau keepingits solitary state apart moved in a rising wind as though theythreatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom upthe two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly and beat atthe great door like a swift messenger rousing those within uneasyrushes of wind went through the hall among the old spears and knivesand passed lamenting up the stairs and shook the curtains of thebed where the last marquis had slept east west north and souththrough the woods four heavytreading unkempt figures crushed thehigh grass and cracked the branches striding on cautiously to come inthe courtyard four lights broke out there and moved away indifferent directions and all was black again  but not for long presently the chateau began to make itselfstrangely visible by some light of its own as though it weregrowing then a flickering streak played behind the architecture ofthe front picking out transparent places and showing wherebalustrades arches and windows were then it soared higher and grewbroader and brighter soon from a score of the great windowsflames burst forth and the stone faces awakened stared out of fire  a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who wereleft there and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away therewas spurring and splashing through the darkness and bridle wasdrawn in the space by the village fountain and the horse in a foamstood at monsieur gabelles door help gabelle help every onethe tocsin rang impatiently but other help if that were any therewas none the mender of roads and two hundred and fifty particularfriends stood with folded arms at the fountain looking at the pillarof fire in the sky it must be forty feet high said they grimlyand never moved  the rider from the chateau and the horse in a foam clatteredaway through the village and galloped up the stony steep to theprison on the crag at the gate a group of officers were looking atthe fire removed from them a group of soldiers help gentlemenofficers the chateau is on fire valuable objects may be saved fromthe flames by timely aid help help the officers looked towards thesoldiers who looked at the fire gave no orders and answered withshrugs and biting of lips it must burn  as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street thevillage was illuminating the mender of roads and the two hundred andfifty particular friends inspired as one man and woman by the idea oflighting up had darted into their houses and were putting candles inevery dull little pane of glass the general scarcity of everythingoccasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner ofmonsieur gabelle and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on thatfunctionarys part the mender of roads once so submissive toauthority had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfireswith and that posthorses would roast  the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn in the roaring andraging of the conflagration a redhot wind driving straight from theinfernal regions seemed to be blowing the edifice away with therising and failing of the blaze the stone faces showed as if theywere in torment when great masses of stone and timber fell theface with the two dints in the nose became obscured anon struggledout of the smoke again as if it were the face of the cruel

figures trudged away east west north andsouth along the nightenshrouded roads guided by the beacon they hadlighted towards their next destination the illuminated village hadseized hold of the tocsin and abolishing the lawful ringer rang forjoy  not only that but the village lightheaded with famine fireand bellringing and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had todo with the collection of rent and taxes though it was but a smallinstalment of taxes and no rent at all that gabelle had got in thoselatter days became impatient for an interview with him andsurrounding his house summoned him to come forth for personalconference whereupon monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his doorand retire to hold counsel with himself the result of that conferencewas that gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind hisstack of chimneys this time resolved if his door were broken inhe was a small southern man of retaliative temperament to pitchhimself head foremost over the parapet and crush a man or two below  probably monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there with thedistant chateau for fire and candle and the beating at his doorcombined with the joyringing for music not to mention his having anillomened lamp slung across the road before his postinghouse gatewhich the village showed a lively inclination to displace in hisfavour a trying suspense to be passing a whole summer night on thebrink of the black ocean ready to take that plunge into it upon whichmonsieur gabelle had resolved but the friendly dawn appearing atlast and the rush candles of the village guttering out the peoplehappily dispersed and monsieur gabelle came down bringing his lifewith him for that while  within a hundred miles and in the light of other fires therewere other functionaries less fortunate that night and othernights whom the rising sun found hanging across oncepeacefulstreets where they had been born and bred also there were othervillagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roadsand his fellows upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turnedwith success and whom they strung up in their turn but the fiercefigures were steadily wending east west north and south be that

thefootsteps of a people tumultuous under a red flag and with theircountry declared in danger changed into wild beasts by terribleenchantment long persisted in  monseigneur as a class had dissociated himself from the phenomenonof his not being appreciated of his being so little wanted infrance as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissalfrom it and this life together like the fabled rustic who raised thedevil with infinite pains and was so terrified at the sight of himthat he could ask the enemy no question but immediately fled somonseigneur after boldly reading the lords prayer backwards for agreat number of years and performing many other potent spells forcompelling the evil one no sooner beheld him in his terrors than hetook to his noble heels  the shining bulls eye of the court was gone or it would havebeen the mark for a hurricane of national bullets it had never beena good eye to see with had long had the mote in it of luciferspride sardanapaluss luxury and a moles blindness but it haddropped out and was gone the court from that exclusive innercircle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue corruption anddissimulation was all gone together royalty was gone had beenbesieged in its palace and suspended when the last tidings cameover  the august of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetytwo wascome and ninetytwo was come and monseigneur was by this timescattered far and wide  as was natural the headquarters and great gatheringplace ofmonseigneur in london was tellsons bank spirits are supposed tohaunt the places where their bodies most resorted and monseigneurwithout a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to bemoreover it was the spot to which such french intelligence as wasmost to be relied upon came quickest again tellsons was amunificent house and extended great liberality to old customers whohad fallen from their high estate again those nobles who had seenthe coming storm in time and anticipating plunder or confiscationhad made provident remittances to tellsons were always to be heardof there by their needy brethren to which it must be added that everynewcomer from france reported himself and his tidings at tellsonsalmost as a matter of course for such variety of reasons tellsonswas at that time as to french intelligence a kind of highexchange and this was so well known to the public and theinquiries made there were in consequence so numerous that tellsonssometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it inthe bank windows for all who ran through temple bar to read  on a steaming misty afternoon mr lorry sat at his desk andcharles darnay stood leaning on it talking with him in a low voicethe penitential den once set apart for interviews with the housewas now the newsexchange and was filled to overflowing it waswithin half an hour or so of the time of closing  but although you are the youngest man that ever lived saidcharles darnay rather hesitating i must still suggest to you  i understand that i am too old said mr lorry  unsettled weather a long journey uncertain means of travelling adisorganised country a city that may not be even safe for you  my dear charles said mr lorry with cheerful confidence youtouch some of the reasons for my going not for my staying away it issafe enough for me nobody will care to interfere with an old fellowof hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much betterworth interfering with as to its being a disorganised city if itwere not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to sendsomebody from our house here to our house there who knows the cityand the business of old and is in tellsons confidence as to theuncertain travelling the long journey and the winter weather if iwere not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for thesake of tellsons after all these years who ought to be  i wish i were going myself said charles darnay somewhatrestlessly and eke one thinking aloud  indeed you are a pretty fellow to object and advise exclaimedmr lorry you wish you were going yourself and you a frenchmanborn you are a wise counsellor  my dear mr lorry it is because i am a frenchman born that thethought which i did not mean to utter here however bas passedthrough my mind often one cannot help thinking having had somesympathy for the miserable people and having abandoned something tothem he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner that onemight be listened to and might have the power to persuade to somerestraint only last night after you had left us when i wastalking to lucie  when you were talking to lucie mr lorry repeated yes i wonderyou are not ashamed to mention the name of lucie wishing you weregoing to france at this time of day  however i am not going said charles darnay with a smile it ismore to the purpose that you say you are  and i am in plain reality the truth is my dear charles mrlorry glanced at the distant house and lowered his voice you canhave no conception of the difficulty with which our business istransacted and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonderare involved the lord above knows what the compromisingconsequences would be to numbers of people if some of our documentswere seized or destroyed and they might be at any time you knowfor who can say that paris is not set afire today or sackedtomorrow now a judicious selection from these with the leastpossible delay and the burying of them or otherwise getting ofthem out of harms way is within the power without loss ofprecious time of scarcely any one but myself if any one and shall ihang back when tellsons knows this and says this tellsons whosebread i have eaten these sixty years because i am a little stiffabout the joints why i am a boy sir to half a dozen old codgershere  how i admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit mr lorry  tut nonsense sir and my dear charles said mr lorryglancing at the house again you are to remember that getting thingsout of paris at this present time no matter what things is next toan impossibility papers and precious matters were this very daybrought to us here i speak in strict confidence it is notbusinesslike to whisper it even to you by the strangest bearersyou can imagine every one of whom had his head hanging on by a singlehair as he passed the barriers at another time our parcels wouldcome and go as easily as in businesslike old england but noweverything is stopped  and do you really go tonight  i really go tonight for the case has become too pressing to admitof delay  and do you take no one with you  all sorts of people have been proposed to me but i will havenothing to say to any of them i intend to take jerry jerry hasbeen my bodyguard on sunday nights for a long time past and i amused to him nobody will suspect jerry of being anything but anenglish bulldog or of having any design in his head but to fly atanybody who touches his master  i must say again that i heartily admire your gallantry andyouthfulness  i must say again nonsense nonsense when i have executed thislittle commission i shall perhaps accept tellsons proposal toretire and live at my ease time enough then to think aboutgrowing old  this dialogue had taken place at mr lorrys usual desk withmonseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it boastful of what hewould do to avenge himself on the rascalpeople before long it wastoo much the way of monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee andit was much too much the way of native british orthodoxy to talk ofthis terrible revolution as if it were the only harvest ever knownunder the skies that had not been sown as if nothing had ever beendone or omitted to be done that had led to it as if observers ofthe wretched millions in france and of the misused and pervertedresources that should have made them prosperous had not seen itinevitably coming years before and had not in plain words recordedwhat they saw such vapouring combined with the extravagant plotsof monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that hadutterly exhausted itself and worn out heaven and earth as well asitself was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any saneman who knew the truth and it was such vapouring all about hisears like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head addedto a latent uneasiness in his mind which had already made charlesdarnay restless and which still kept him so  among the talkers was stryver of the kings bench bar far onhis way to state promotion and therefore loud on the themebroaching to monseigneur his devices for blowing the people up andexterminating them from the face of the earth and doing without themand for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to theabolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the racehim darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection and darnaystood divided between going away that he might hear no more andremaining to interpose his word when the thing that was to be wenton to shape itself out  the house approached mr lorry and laying a soiled and unopenedletter before him asked if he had yet discovered any traces of theperson to whom it was addressed the house laid the letter down soclose to darnay that he saw the direction the more quickly because itwas his own right name the address turned into english ran  very pressing to monsieur heretofore the marquis st evremonde offrance confided to the cares of messrs tellson and co bankerslondon england  on the marriage morning doctor manette had made it his one urgentand express

concerning the marquiswho was not to be found  nephew i believe but in any case degenerate successor of thepolished marquis who was murdered said one happy to say i neverknew him  a craven who abandoned his post said another this monseigneurhad been got out of paris legs uppermost and half suffocated in aload of hay some years ago  infected with the new doctrines said a third eyeing

hopeas he deserves  hey cried the blatant stryver did he though is that the sortof fellow let us look at his infamous name dn the fellow  darnay unable to restrain himself any longer touched mr stryveron the shoulder and said  i know the fellow  do you by jupiter said stryver i am sorry for it  why mr darnay dye hear what he did dont ask why in thesetimes  but i do ask why  then i tell you

andsneak away  with those words and a final snap of his fingers mr stryvershouldered himself into fleetstreet amidst the general approbationof his hearers mr lorry and charles darnay were left alone

peril of an old servant and a good one whoseonly crime was fidelity to himself and his family stared him soreproachfully in the face that as he walked to and fro in the templeconsidering what to do he almost hid his face from the passersby  he knew very well that in his horror of the deed which hadculminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family housein his resentful suspicions of his uncle and in the aversion withwhich his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he wassupposed to uphold he had acted imperfectly he knew very wellthat in his love for lucie his renunciation of his social placethough by no means new to his own mind had been hurried andincomplete he knew that he ought to have systematically worked it outand supervised it and that he had meant to do it and that it hadnever been done  the happiness of his own chosen english home the necessity of beingalways actively employed the swift changes and troubles of the timewhich had followed on one another so fast that the events of thisweek annihilated the immature plans of last week and the events ofthe week following made all new again he knew very well that tothe force of these circumstances he had yielded not withoutdisquiet but still without continuous and accumulating resistancethat he had watched the times for a time of action and that theyhad shifted and struggled until the time had gone by and the nobilitywere trooping from france by every highway and byway and theirproperty was in course of confiscation and destruction and their verynames were blotting out was as well known to himself as it could beto any new authority in france that might impeach him for it  but he had oppressed no man he had imprisoned no man he was sofar from having harshly exacted payment of his dues that he hadrelinquished them of his own will thrown himself on a world with nofavour in it won his own private place there and earned his ownbread monsieur gabelle had held the impoverished and involvedestate on written instructions to spare the people to give them whatlittle there was to give such fuel as the heavy creditors would letthem have in the winter and such produce as could be saved from thesame grip in the summer and no doubt he had put the fact in pleaand proof for his own safety so that it could not but appear now  this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun tomake that he would go to paris  yes like the mariner in the old story the winds and streams haddriven him within the influence of the loadstone rock and it wasdrawing him to itself and he must go everything that arose beforehis mind drifted him on faster and faster more and more steadily tothe terrible attraction his latent uneasiness had been that bad aimswere being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instrumentsand that he who could not fail to know that he was better than theywas not there trying to do something to stay bloodshed and assertthe claims of mercy and humanity with this uneasiness half stifledand half reproaching him be had been brought to the pointedcomparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was sostrong upon that comparison injurious to himself had instantlyfollowed the sneers of monseigneur which had stung him bitterlyand those of stryver which above all were coarse and galling for oldreasons upon those had followed gabelles letter the appeal of aninnocent prisoner in danger of death to his justice honour andgood name  his resolution was made he must go to paris  yes the loadstone rock was drawing him and he must sail onuntil he struck he knew of no rock he saw hardly any danger theintention with which he had done what he had done even although hehad left it incomplete presented it before him in an aspect thatwould be gratefully acknowledged in france on his presenting himselfto assert it then that glorious vision of doing good which is sooften the sanguine mirage of so many good minds arose before him andhe even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guidethis raging revolution that was running so fearfully wild  as he walked to and fro with his resolution made he considered thatneither lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gonelucie should be spared the pain of separation and her fatheralways reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous groundof old should come to the knowledge of the step as a step taken andnot in the balance of suspense and doubt how much of theincompleteness of his situation was referable to her father throughthe painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of france inhis mind he did not discuss with himself but that circumstance toohad had its influence in his course  he walked to and fro with thoughts very busy until it was timeto return to tellsons and take leave of mr lorry as soon as hearrived in paris he would present himself to this old friend but hemust say nothing of his intention now  a carriage with posthorses was ready at the bank door and jerrywas booted and equipped  i have delivered that letter said charles darnay to mr lorry iwould not consent to your being charged with any written answer butperhaps you will take a verbal one  that i will and readily said mr lorry if it is notdangerous  not at all though it is to a prisoner in the abbaye  what is his name said mr lorry with his open pocketbook in hishand  gabelle  gabelle and what is the message to the unfortunate gabelle inprison  simply that he has received the letter and will come  any time mentioned  he will start upon his journey tomorrow night  any person mentioned  no  he helped mr lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaksand went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old bank intothe misty air of fleetstreet my love to lucie and to littlelucie said mr lorry at parting and take precious care of themtill i come back charles darnay shook his head and doubtfullysmiled as the carriage rolled away  that night it was the fourteenth of august he sat up late andwrote two fervent letters one was to lucie explaining the strongobligation he was under to go to paris and showing her at lengththe reasons that he had for feeling confident that he could becomeinvolved in no personal danger there the other was to the doctorconfiding lucie and their dear child to his care and dwelling onthe same topics with the strongest assurances to both he wrotethat he would despatch letters in proof of his safety immediatelyafter his arrival  it was a hard day that day of being among them with the firstreservation of their joint lives on his mind it was a hard matterto preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundlyunsuspicious but an affectionate glance at his wife so happy andbusy made him resolute not to tell her what impended he had beenhalf moved to do it so strange it was to him to act in anythingwithout her quiet aid and the day passed quickly early in theevening he embraced her and her scarcely less dear namesakepretending that he would return byandbye an imaginary engagementtook him out and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready and sohe emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets with a heavierheart  the unseen force was drawing him fast to itself now and all thetides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it he lefthis two letters with a trusty porter to be delivered half an hourbefore midnight and no sooner took horse for dover and began hisjourney for the love of heaven of justice of generosity of thehonour of your noble name was the poor prisoners cry with whichhe strengthened his sinking heart as he left all that was dear onearth behind him and floated away for the loadstone rock                 the end of the second book                                 book the third                              the track of a storm  i  in secret  the traveller fared slowly on his way who fared towards parisfrom england in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundredand ninetytwo more than enough of bad roads bad equipages andbad horses he would have encountered to delay him though thefallen and unfortunate king of france had been upon his throne inall his glory but the changed times were fraught with otherobstacles than these every towngate and village taxinghouse had itsband of citizenpatriots with their national muskets in a mostexplosive state of readiness who stopped all comers and goerscrossquestioned them inspected their papers looked for theirnames in lists of their own turned them back or sent them on orstopped them and laid them in hold as their capricious judgment orfancy deemed best for the dawning republic one and indivisible ofliberty equality fraternity or death  a very few french leagues of his journey were accomplished whencharles darnay began to perceive that for him along these countryroads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared agood citizen at paris whatever might befall now he must on to hisjourneys end not a mean village closed upon him not a commonbarrier dropped across the road behind him but he knew it to beanother iron door in the series that was barred between him andengland the universal watchfulness so encompassed him that if he hadbeen taken in a net or were being forwarded to his destination in acage he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone  this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highwaytwenty times in a stage but retarded his progress twenty times in aday by riding after him and taking him back riding before him andstopping him by anticipation riding with him and keeping him incharge he had been days upon his journey in france alone when hewent to bed tired out in a little town on the high road still a longway from paris  nothing but the production of the afflicted gabelles letter fromhis prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far hisdifficulty at the guardhouse in this small place had been suchthat he felt his journey to have come to a crisis and he wastherefore as little surprised as a man could be to find himselfawakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morningin the middle of the night  awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots inrough red caps and with pipes in their mouths who sat down on thebed  emigrant said the functionary i am going to send you on toparis under an escort  citizen i desire nothing more than to get to paris though i coulddispense with the escort  silence growled a redcap striking at the coverlet with thebuttend of his musket peace aristocrat  it is as the good patriot says observed the timid functionaryyou are an aristocrat and must have an escort and must pay for it  i have no choice said charles darnay  choice listen to him cried the same scowling redcap as ifit was not a favour to be protected from the lampiron  it is always as the good patriot says observed the functionaryrise and dress yourself emigrant  darnay complied and was taken back to the guardhouse whereother patriots in rough red caps were smoking drinking and sleepingby a watchfire here he paid a heavy price for his escort andhence he started with it on the wet wet roads at three oclock in themorning  the escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tricolouredcockades armed with national muskets and sabres who rode one oneither side of him  the escorted governed his own horse but a loose line was attachedto his bridle the end of which one of the patriots kept girdedround his wrist in this state they set forth with the sharp raindriving in their faces clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over theuneven town pavement and out upon the miredeep roads in thisstate they traversed without change except of horses and pace allthe miredeep leagues that lay between them and the capital  they travelled in the night halting an hour or two afterdaybreak and lying by until the twilight fell the escort were sowretchedly clothed that they twisted straw round their bare legs andthatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off apart from thepersonal discomfort of being so attended and apart from suchconsiderations of present danger as arose from one of the patriotsbeing chronically drunk and carrying his musket very recklesslycharles darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him toawaken any serious fears in his breast for be reasoned withhimself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individualcase that was not yet stated and of representations confirmable bythe prisoner in the abbaye that were not yet made  but when they came to the town of beauvais which they did ateventide when the streets were filled with people he could notconceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarmingan ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the postingyard andmany voices called out loudly down with the emigrant  he stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle andresuming it as his safest place said  emigrant my friends do you not see me here in france of myown will  you are a cursed emigrant cried a farrier making at him in afurious manner through the press hammer in hand and you are acursed aristocrat  the postmaster interposed himself between this man and the ridersbridle at which he was evidently making and soothingly said lethim be let him be he will be judged at paris  judged repeated the farrier swinging his hammer ay andcondemned as a traitor at this the crowd roared approval  checking the postmaster who was for turning his horses head to theyard the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking onwith the line round his wrist darnay said as soon as he couldmake his voice heard  friends you deceive yourselves or you are deceived i am not atraitor  he lies cried the smith he is a traitor since the decree hislife is forfeit to the people his cursed life is not his own  at the instant when darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowdwhich another instant would have brought upon him the postmasterturned his horse into the yard the escort rode in close upon hishorses flanks and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy doublegates the farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer and thecrowd groaned but no more was done  what is this decree that the smith spoke of darnay asked thepostmaster when he had thanked him and stood beside him in the yardtruly a decree for selling the property of emigrants  when passed  on the fourteenth  the day i left england  everybody says it is but one of several and that there will beothers if there are not already banishing all emigrants andcondemning all to death who return that is what he meant when he saidyour life was not your own  but there are no such decrees yet  what do i know said the postmaster shrugging his shouldersthere may be or there will be it is all the same what would youhave  they rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the nightand then rode forward again when all the town was asleep among themany wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wildride unreal not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep after longand lonely spurring over dreary roads they would come to a cluster ofpoor cottages not steeped in darkness but all glittering withlights and would find the people in a ghostly manner in the deadof the night circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree ofliberty or all drawn up together singing a liberty song happilyhowever there was sleep in beauvais that night to help them out of itand they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness jinglingthrough the untimely cold and wet among impoverished fields thathad yielded no fruits of the earth that year diversified by theblackened remains of burnt houses and by the sudden emergence fromambuscade and sharp reining up across their way of patriot patrolson the watch on all the roads  daylight at last found them before the wall of paris the barrierwas closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it  where are the papers of this prisoner demanded a resolutelookingman in authority who was summoned out by the guard  naturally struck by the disagreeable word charles darnayrequested the speaker to take notice that he was a free travellerand french citizen in charge of an escort which the disturbed stateof the country had imposed upon him and which he had paid for  where repeated the same personage without taking any heed of himwhatever are the papers of this prisoner  the drunken patriot had them in his cap and produced themcasting his eyes over gabelles letter the same personage inauthority showed some disorder and surprise and looked at darnay witha close attention  he left escort and escorted without saying a word however and wentinto the guardroom meanwhile they sat upon their horses outside thegate looking about him while in this state of suspense charlesdarnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiersand patriots the latter far outnumbering the former and that whileingress into the city for peasants carts bringing in supplies andfor similar traffic and traffickers was easy enough egress even forthe homeliest people was very difficult a numerous medley of men andwomen not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts waswaiting to issue forth but the previous identification was sostrict that they filtered through the barrier very slowly some ofthese people knew their turn for examination to be so far off thatthey lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke while others talkedtogether or loitered about the red cap and tricolour cockade wereuniversal both among men and women  when he had sat in his saddle some halfhour taking note of thesethings darnay found himself confronted by the same man inauthority who directed the guard to open the barrier then hedelivered to the escort drunk and sober a receipt for theescorted and requested him to dismount he did so and the twopatriots leading his tired horse turned and rode away withoutentering the city  he accompanied his conductor into a guardroom smelling of commonwine and tobacco where certain soldiers and patriots asleep andawake drunk and sober and in various neutral states between sleepingand waking drunkenness and sobriety were standing and lying aboutthe light in the guardhouse half derived from the waning oillampsof the night and half from the overcast day was in a correspondinglyuncertain condition some registers were lying open on a desk andan officer of a coarse dark aspect presided over these  citizen defarge said he to darnays conductor as he took aslip of paper to write on is this the emigrant evremonde  this is the man  your age evremonde  thirtyseven  married evremonde  yes  where married  in england  without doubt where is your wife evremonde  in england  without doubt your are consigned evremonde to the prison of laforce  just heaven exclaimed darnay under what law and for whatoffence  the officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment  we have new laws evremonde and new offences since you werehere he said it with a hard smile and went on writing  i entreat you to observe that i have come here voluntarily inresponse to that written appeal of a fellowcountryman which liesbefore you i demand no more than the opportunity to do so withoutdelay is not that my right  emigrants have no rights evremonde was the stolid reply theofficer wrote until he had finished read over to himself what hehad written sanded it and handed it to defarge with the words insecret  defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he mustaccompany him the prisoner obeyed and a guard of two armedpatriots attended them  is it you said defarge in a low voice as they went down theguardhouse steps and turned into paris who married the daughter ofdoctor manette once a prisoner in the bastille that is no more  yes replied darnay looking at him with surprise  my name is defarge and i keep a wineshop in the quarter saintantoine possibly you have heard of me  my wife came to your house to reclaim her father yes  the word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to defargeto say with sudden impatience in the name of that sharp femalenewlyborn and called la guillotine why did you come to france  you heard me say why a minute ago do you not believe it is thetruth  a bad truth for you said defarge speaking with knitted browsand looking straight before him  indeed i am lost here all here is so unprecedented so changed sosudden and unfair that i am absolutely lost will you render me alittle help  none defarge spoke always looking straight before him  will you answer me a single question  perhaps according to its nature you can say what it is in this prison that i am going to so unjustly shall i have somefree communication with the world outside  you will see  i am not to be buried there prejudged and without any means ofpresenting my case  you will see but what then other people have been similarlyburied in worse prisons before now  but never by me citizen defarge  defarge glanced darkly at him for answer and walked on in asteady and set silence the deeper he sank into this silence thefainter hope there was or so darnay thought of his softening inany slight degree he therefore made haste to say  it is of the utmost importance to me you know citizen evenbetter than i of how much importance that i should be able tocommunicate to mr lorry of tellsons bank an english gentleman whois now in paris the simple fact without comment that i have beenthrown into the prison of la force will you cause that to be done forme  i will do defarge doggedly rejoined nothing for you my duty isto my country and the people i am the sworn servant of bothagainst you i will do nothing for you  charles darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further and hispride was touched besides as they walked on in silnce he could notbut see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passingalong the streets the very children scarcely noticed him a fewpassers turned their heads and a few shook their fingers at him as anaristocrat otherwise that a man in good clothes should be going toprison was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothesshould be going to work in one narrow dark and dirty street throughwhich they passed an excited orator mounted on a stool wasaddressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people ofthe king and the royal family the few words that he caught fromthis mans lips first made it known to charles darnay that the kingwas in prison and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all leftparis on the road except at beauvais he had heard absolutelynothing the escort and the universal watchfulness had completelyisolated him  that he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which haddeveloped themselves when he left england he of course knew now thatperils had thickened about him fast and might thicken faster andfaster yet he of course knew now he could not but admit to himselfthat he might not have made this journey if he could have foreseenthe events of a few days and yet his misgivings were not so darkas imagined by the light of this later time they would appeartroubled as the future was it was the unknown future and in itsobscurity there was ignorant hope the horrible massacre days andnights long which within a few rounds of the clock was to set agreat mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest was asfar out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand yearsaway the sharp female newlyborn and called la guillotine washardly known to him or to the generality of people by name thefrightful deeds that were to be soon done were probably unimagined atthat time in the brains of the doers how could they have a place inthe shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind  of unjust treatment in detention and hardship and in cruelseparation from his wife and child he foreshadowed the likelihood orthe certainty but beyond this he dreaded nothing distinctly withthis on his mind which was enough to carry into a dreary prisoncourtyard he arrived at the prison of la force  a man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket to whomdefarge presented the emigrant evremonde  what the devil how many more of them exclaimed the man withthe bloated face  defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation andwithdrew with his two fellowpatriots  what the devil i say again exclaimed the gaoler left with hiswife how many more  the gaolers wife being provided with no answer to the questionmerely replied one must have patience my dear three turnkeyswho entered responsive to a bell she rang echoed the sentiment andone added for the love of liberty which sounded in that place likean inappropriate conclusion  the prison of la force was a gloomy prison dark and filthy andwith a horrible smell of foul sleep in it extraordinary how soonthe noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep becomes manifest in allsuch places that are ill cared for  in secret too grumbled the gaoler looking at the written paperas if i was not already full to bursting  he stuck the paper on a file in an illhumour and charles darnayawaited his further pleasure for half an hour sometimes pacing toand fro in the strong arched room sometimes resting on a stone seatin either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief andhis subordinates  come said the chief at length taking up his keys come with meemigrant  through the dismal prison twilight his new charge accompanied himby corridor and staircase many doors clanging and locking behindthem until they came into a large low vaulted chamber crowded withprisoners of both sexes the women were seated at a long tablereading and writing knitting sewing and embroidering the menwere for the most part standing behind their chairs or lingering upand down the room  in the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crimeand disgrace the newcomer recoiled from this company but thecrowning unreality of his long unreal ride was their all at oncerising to receive him with every refinement of manner known to thetime and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life  so strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison mannersand gloom so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalorand misery through which they were seen that charles darnay seemed tostand in a company of the dead ghosts all the ghost of beauty theghost of stateliness the ghost of elegance the ghost of pride theghost of frivolity the ghost of wit the ghost of youth the ghost ofage all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore allturning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died incoming there  it struck him motionless the gaoler standing at his side and theother gaolers moving about who would have been well enough as toappearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions looked soextravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and bloomingdaughters who were there with the apparitions of the coquette theyoung beauty and the mature woman delicately bred that the inversionof all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presentedwas heightened to its utmost surely ghosts all surely the longunreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to thesegloomy shades  in the name of the assembled companions in misfortune said agentleman of courtly appearance and address coming forward i havethe honour of giving you welcome to la force and of condoling withyou on the calamity that has brought you among us may it soonterminate happily it would be an impertinence elsewhere but it isnot so here to ask your name and condition  charles darnay roused himself and gave the required information inwords as suitable as he could find  but i hope said the gentleman following the chief gaoler withhis eyes who moved across the room that you are not in secret  i do not understand the meaning of the term but i have heardthem say so  ah what a pity we so much regret it but take courage severalmembers of our society have been in secret at first and it haslasted but a short time then he added raising his voice igrieve to inform the society in secret  there was a murmur of commiseration as charles darnay crossed theroom to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him and many voicesamong which the soft and compassionate voices of women wereconspicuous gave him good wishes and encouragement he turned atthe grated door to render the thanks of his heart it closed underthe gaolers hand and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever  the wicket opened on a stone staircase leading upward when theyhad ascended forty steps the prisoner of half an hour already countedthem the gaoler opened a low black door and they passed into asolitary cell it struck cold and damp but was not dark  yours said the gaoler  why am i confined alone  how do i know  i can buy pen ink and paper  such are not my orders you will be visited and can ask then atpresent you may buy your food and nothing more  there were in the cell a chair a table and a straw mattress asthe gaoler made a general inspection of these objects and of the fourwalls before going out a wandering fancy wandered through the mindof the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him that thisgaoler was so unwholesomely bloated both in face and person as tolook like a man who had been drowned and filled with water when thegaoler was gone he thought in the same wandering way now am i leftas if i were dead stopping then to look down at the mattress heturned from it with a sick feeling and thought and here in thesecrawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death five paces by four and a half five paces by four and a half fivepaces by four and a half the prisoner walked to and fro in his cellcounting its measurement and the roar of the city arose likemuffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them he madeshoes he made shoes he made shoes the prisoner counted themeasurement again and paced faster to draw his mind with him fromthat latter repetition the ghosts that vanished when the wicketclosed there was one among them the appearance of a lady dressedin black who was leaning in the embrasure of a window

hemade shoes     five paces by four and a half with such scrapstossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind the prisonerwalked faster and faster obstinately counting and counting and theroar of the city changed to this extent that it still rolled inlike muffled drums but with the wall of voices that he knew in theswell that rose above them  ii  the grindstone  tellsons bank established in the saint germain quarter of pariswas in a wing of a large house approached by a courtyard and shut offfrom the street by a high wall and a strong gate the house belongedto a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight fromthe troubles in his own cooks dress and got across the borders amere beast of the chase flying from hunters he was still in hismetempsychosis no other than the same monseigneur the preparationof whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong menbesides the cook in question  monseigneur gone and the three strong men absolving themselves fromthe sin of having drawn his high wages by being more than ready andwilling to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning republic one andindivisible of liberty equality fraternity or deathmonseigneurs house had been first sequestrated and then confiscatedfor all things moved so fast and decree followed decree with thatfierce precipitation that now upon the third night of the autumnmonth of september patriot emissaries of the law were in possessionof monseigneurs house and had marked it with the tricolour and weredrinking brandy in its state apartments  a place of business in london like tellsons place of business inparis would soon have driven the house out of its mind and into thegazette for what would staid british responsibility andrespectability have said to orangetrees in boxes in a bank courtyardand even to a cupid over the counter yet such things weretellsons had whitewashed the cupid but he was still to be seen onthe ceiling in the coolest linen aiming as he very often

lookingglasslet into the wall and also of clerks not at all old who danced inpublic on the slightest provocation yet a french tellsons could geton with these things exceedingly well and as long as the timesheld together no man had taken fright at them and drawn out hismoney  what money would be drawn out of tellsons henceforth and whatwould lie there lost and forgotten what plate and jewels wouldtarnish in tellsons hidingplaces while the depositors rusted inprisons and when they should have violently perished how manyaccounts with tellsons never to be balanced in this world must becarried over into the next no man could have said that night anymore than mr jarvis lorry could though he thought heavily of thesequestions he sat by a newlylighted wood fire the blighted andunfruitful year was prematurely cold and on his honest andcourageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp couldthrow or any object in the room distortedly reflect a shade ofhorror  he occupied rooms in the bank in his fidelity to the house of whichhe had grown to be a part like strong rootivy it chanced thatthey derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of themain building but the truehearted old gentleman never calculatedabout that all such circumstances were indifferent to him so that hedid his duty on the opposite side of the courtyard under acolonnade was extensive standing for carriages where indeed somecarriages of monseigneur yet stood against two of the pillars werefastened two great flaring flambeaux and in the light of thesestanding out in the open air was a large grindstone a roughlymounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there fromsome neighbouring smithy or other workshop rising and looking out ofwindow at these harmless objects mr lorry shivered and retired tohis seat by the fire he had opened not only the glass window butthe lattice blind outside it and he had closed both again and heshivered through his frame  from the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate therecame the usual night hum of the city with now and then anindescribable ring in it weird and unearthly as if some unwontedsounds of a terrible nature were going up to heaven  thank god said mr lorry clasping his hands that no one near anddear to me is in this dreadful town tonight may he have mercy on allwho are in danger  soon afterwards the bell at the great gate sounded and he thoughtthey have come back and sat listening but there was no loudirruption into the courtyard as he had expected and he heard thegate clash again and all was quiet  the nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vagueuneasiness respecting the bank which a great change would naturallyawaken with such feelings roused it was well guarded and he gotup to go among the trusty people who were watching it when his doorsuddenly opened and two figures rushed in at sight of which hefell back in amazement  lucie and her father lucie with her arms stretched out to himand with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensifiedthat it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expresslyto give force and power to it in this one passage of her life  what is this cried mr lorry breathless and confused what isthe matter lucie manette what has happened what has brought youhere what is it  with the look fixed upon him in her paleness and wildness shepanted out in his arms imploringly o my dear friend my husband  your husband lucie  charles  what of charles  here  here in paris  has been here some days three or four i dont know how many icant collect my thoughts an errand of generosity brought him hereunknown to us he was stopped at the barrier and sent to prison  the old man uttered an irrepressible cry almost at the same momentthe bell of the great gate rang again and a loud noise of feet andvoices came pouring into the courtyard  what is that noise said the doctor turning towards the window  dont look cried mr lorry dont look out manette for yourlife dont touch the blind  the doctor turned with his hand upon the fastening of the windowand said with a cool bold smile my dear friend i have a charmedlife in this city i have been a bastille prisoner there is nopatriot in paris in paris in france who knowing me to have beena prisoner in the bastille would touch me except to overwhelm mewith embraces or carry me in triumph my old pain has given me apower that has brought us through the barrier and gained us news ofcharles there and brought us here i knew it would be so i knew icould help charles out of all danger i told lucie so what is thatnoise his hand was again upon the window  dont look cried mr lorry absolutely desperate no luciemy dear nor you he got his arm round her and held her dont beso terrified my love i solemnly swear to you that i know of noharm having happened to charles that i had no suspicion even of hisbeing in this fatal place what prison is he in  la force  la force lucie my child if ever you were brave and serviceablein your life and you were always both you will compose yourself nowto do exactly as i bid you for more depends upon it than you canthink or i can say there is no help for you in any action on yourpart tonight you cannot possibly stir out i say this becausewhat i must bid you to do for charless sake is the hardest thingto do of all you must instantly be obedient still and quiet youmust let me put you in a room at the back here you must leave yourfather and me alone for two minutes and as there are life and deathin the world you must not delay  i will be submissive to you i see in your face that you know i cando nothing else than this i know you are true  the old man kissed her and hurried her into his room and turnedthe key then came hurrying back to the doctor and opened the windowand partly opened the window and partly opened the blind and puthis hand upon the doctors arm and looked out with him into thecourtyard  looked out upon a throng of men and women not enough in numberor near enough to fill the courtyard not more than forty or fifty inall the people in possession of the house had let them in at thegate and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone it hadevidently been set up there for their purpose as in a convenientand retired spot  but such awful workers and such awful work  the grindstone had a double handle and turning at it madly weretwo men whose faces as their long hair flapped back when thewhirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up were more horribleand cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their mostbarbarous disguise false eyebrows and false moustaches were stuckupon them and their hideous countenances were all bloody andsweaty and all awry with bowling and all staring and glaring withbeastly excitement and want of sleep as these ruffians turned andturned their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes nowflung backward over their necks some women held wine to theirmouths that they might drink and what with dropping blood and whatwith dropping wine and what with the stream of sparks struck out ofthe stone all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire the eyecould not detect one creature in the group free from the smear ofblood shouldering one another to get next at the sharpeningstonewere men stripped to the waist with the stain all over their limbsand bodies men in all sorts of rags with the stain upon thoserags men devilishly set off with spoils of womens lace and silkand ribbon with the stain dyeing those trifles through and throughhatchets knives bayonets swords all brought to be sharpenedwere all red with it some of the hacked swords were tied to thewrists of those who carried them with strips of linen and fragmentsof dress ligatures various in kind but all deep of the one colourand as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from thestream of sparks and tore away into the streets the same red huewas red in their frenzied eyes eyes which any unbrutalisedbeholder would have given twenty years of life to petrify with awelldirected gun  all this was seen in a moment as the vision of a drowning man orof any human creature at any very great pass could see a world ifit were there they drew back from the window and the doctor lookedfor explanation in his friends ashy face  they are mr lorry whispered the words glancing fearfullyround at the locked room murdering the prisoners if you are sure ofwhat you say if you really have the power you think you have as ibelieve you have make yourself known to these devils and get takento la force it may be too late i dont know but let it not be aminute later  doctor manette pressed his hand hastened bareheaded out of theroom and was in the courtyard when mr lorry regained the blind  his streaming white hair his remarkable face and the impetuousconfidence of his manner as he put the weapons aside like watercarried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at thestone for a few moments there was a pause and a hurry and a murmurand the unintelligible sound of his voice and then mr lorry saw himsurrounded by all and in the midst of a line of twenty men longall linked shoulder to shoulder and hand to shoulder hurried outwith cries of live the bastille prisoner help for the bastilleprisoners kindred in la force room for the bastille prisoner infront there save the prisoner evremonde at la force and athousand answering shouts  he closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart closed thewindow and the curtain hastened to lucie and told her that herfather was assisted by the people and gone in search of herhusband he found her child and miss pross with her but it neveroccurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a longtime afterwards when he sat watching them in such quiet as thenight knew  lucie had by that time fallen into a stupor on the floor at hisfeet clinging to his hand miss pross had laid the child down onhis own bed and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow besideher pretty charge o the long long night with the moans of thepoor wife and o the long long night with no return of her fatherand no tidings  twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded andthe irruption was repeated and the grindstone whirled and splutteredwhat is it cried lucie affrighted hush the soldiers swords aresharpened there said mr lorry the place is national property nowand used as a kind of armoury my love  twice more in all but the last spell of work was feeble andfitful soon afterwards the day began to dawn and he softlydetached himself from the clasping hand and cautiously looked outagain a man so besmeared that he might have been a sorely woundedsoldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain was risingfrom the pavement by the side of the grindstone and looking about himwith a vacant air shortly this wornout murderer descried in theimperfect light one of the carriages of monseigneur and staggeringto that gorgeous vehicle climbed in at the door and shut himselfup to take his rest on its dainty cushions  the great grindstone earth had turned when mr lorry looked outagain and the sun was red on the courtyard but the lessergrindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air with a redupon it that the sun had never given and would never take away  iii  the shadow  one of the first considerations which arose in the business mindof mr lorry when business hours came round was this that he had noright to imperil tellsons by sheltering the wife of an emigrantprisoner under the bank roof his own possessions safety life hewould have hazarded for lucie and her child without a moments demurbut the great trust he held was not his own and as to that businesscharge he was a strict man of business  at first his mind reverted to defarge and he thought of findingout the wineshop again and taking counsel with its master inreference to the safest dwellingplace in the distracted state ofthe city but the same consideration that suggested him repudiatedhim he lived in the most violent quarter and doubtless wasinfluential there and deep in its dangerous workings  noon coming and the doctor not returning and every minutesdelay tending to compromise tellsons mr lorry advised with lucieshe said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a shortterm in that quarter near the bankinghouse as there was nobusiness objection to this and as he foresaw that even if it were allwell with charles and he were to be released he could not hope toleave the city mr lorry went out in quest of such a lodging andfound a suitable one high up in a removed bystreet where theclosed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy squareof buildings marked deserted homes  to this lodging he at once removed lucie and her child and misspross giving them what comfort he could and much more than he hadhimself he left jerry with them as a figure to fill a doorway thatwould bear considerable knocking on the head and returned to hisown occupations a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bearupon them and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him  it wore itself out and wore him out with it until the bank closedhe was again alone in his room of the previous night considering whatto do next when be heard a foot upon the stair in a few moments aman stood in his presence who with a keenly observant look at himaddressed him by his name  your servant said mr lorry do you know me  he was a strongly made man with dark curling hair from fortyfiveto fifty years of age for answer he repeated without any change ofemphasis the words  do you know me  i have seen you somewhere  perhaps at my wineshop  much interested and agitated mr lorry said you come fromdoctor manette  yes i come from doctor manette  and what says he what does he send me  defarge gave into his anxious hand an open scrap of paper itbore the words in the doctors writing  charles is safe but i cannot safely leave this place yet i haveobtained the favour that the bearer has a short note from charles tohis wife let the bearer see his wife  it was dated from la force within an hour  will you accompany me said mr lorry joyfully relieved afterreading this note aloud to where his wife resides  yes returned defarge  scarcely noticing as yet in what a curiously reserved andmechanical way defarge spoke mr lorry put on his hat and they wentdown into the courtyard there they found two women one knitting  madame defarge surely said mr lorry who had left her inexactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago  it is she observed her husband  does madame go with us inquired mr lorry seeing that shemoved as they moved  yes that she may be able to recognise the faces and know thepersons it is for their safety  beginning to be strack by defarges manner mr lorry lookeddubiously at him and led the way both the women followed the secondwoman being the vengeance  they passed through the intervening streets as quickly as theymight ascended the staircase of the new domicile were admitted byjerry and found lucie weeping alone she was thrown into a transportby the tidings mr lorry gave her of her husband and clasped the handthat delivered his note little thinking what it had been doing nearhim in the night and might but for a chance have done to him  dearest take courage i am well and your father has influencearound me you cannot answer this kiss our child for me  that was all the writing it was so much however to her whoreceived it that she turned from defarge to his wife and kissedone of the hands that knitted it was a passionate lovingthankful womanly action but the hand made no response droppedcold and heavy and took to its knitting again  there was something in its touch that gave lucie a check shestopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom and with herhands yet at her neck looked terrified at madame defarge madamedefarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold impassivestare  my dear said mr lorry striking in to explain there arefrequent risings in the streets and although it is not likely theywill ever trouble you madame defarge wishes to see those whom she hasthe power to protect at such times to the end that she may know themthat she may identify them i believe said mr lorry rather haltingin his reassuring words as the stony manner of an the three impresseditself upon him more and more i state the case citizen defarge  defarge looked gloomily at his wife and gave no other answer than agruff sound of acquiescence  you had better lucie said mr lorry doing all he could topropitiate by tone and manner have the dear child here and ourgood pross our good pross defarge is an english lady and knowsno french  the lady in question whose rooted conviction that she was more thana match for any foreigner was not to be shaken by distress anddanger appeared with folded arms and observed in english to thevengeance whom her eyes first encountered well i am sureboldface i hope you are pretty well she also bestowed a britishcough on madame defarge but neither of the two took much heed ofher  is that his child said madame defarge stopping in her work forthe fust time and pointing her knittingneedle at little lucie asif it were the finger of fate  yes madame answered mr lorry this is our poor prisonersdarling daughter and only child  the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed tofall so threatening and dark on the child that her motherinstinctively kneeled on the ground beside her and held her to herbreast the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemedthen to fall threatening and dark on both the mother and the child  it is enough my husband said madame defarge i have seenthem we may go  but the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it not visibleand presented but indistinct and withheld to alarm lucie intosaying as she laid her appealing hand on madame defarges dress  you will be good to my poor husband you will do him no harm youwill help me to see him if you can  your husband is not my business here returned madame defargelooking down at her with perfect composure it is the daughter ofyour father who is my business here  for my sake then be merciful to my husband for my childssake she will put her hands together and pray you to be mercifulwe are more afraid of you than of these others  madame defarge received it as a compliment and looked at herhusband defarge who had been uneasily biting his thumbnail andlooking at her collected his face into a sterner expression  what is it that your husband says in that little letter askedmadame defarge with a lowering smile influence he says somethingtouching influence  that my father said lucie hurriedly taking the paper from herbreast but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on ithas much influence around him  surely it will release him said madame defarge let it do so  as a wife and mother cried lucie most earnestly i imploreyou to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possessagainst my innocent husband but to use it in his behalf osisterwoman think of me as a wife and mother  madame defarge looked coldly as ever at the suppliant and saidturning to her friend the vengeance  the wives and mothers we have been used to see since we were aslittle as this child and much less have not been greatly consideredwe have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and keptfrom them often enough all our lives we have seen oursisterwomen suffer in themselves and in their children povertynakedness hunger thirst sickness misery oppression and neglect ofall kinds  we have seen nothing else returned the vengeance  we have borne this a long time said madame defarge turning hereyes again upon lucie judge you is it likely that the trouble ofone wife and mother would be much to us now  she resumed her knitting and went out the vengeance followeddefarge went last and closed the door  courage my dear lucie said mr lorry as he raised hercourage courage so far all goes well with us much much betterthan it has of late gone with many poor souls cheer up and have athankful heart  i am not thankless i hope but that dreadful woman seems tothrow a shadow on me and on all my hopes  tut tut said mr lorry what is this despondency in the bravelittle breast a shadow indeed no substance in it lucie  but the shadow of the manner of these defarges was dark uponhimself for an that and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly  iv  calm in storm  doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day ofhis absence so much of what had happened in that dreadful time ascould be kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed fromher that not until long afterwards when france and she were farapart did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners ofboth sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace that fourdays and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror and that theair around her had been tainted by the slain she only knew that therehad been an attack upon the prisons that all political prisonershad been in danger and that some had been dragged out by the crowdand murdered  to mr lorry the doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecyon which he had no need to dwell that the crowd had taken him througha scene of carnage to the prison of la force that in the prison hehad found a selfappointed tribunal sitting before which theprisoners were brought singly and by which they were rapidlyordered to be put forth to be massacred or to be released or in afew cases to be sent back to their cells that presented by hisconductors to this tribunal he had announced himself by name andprofession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccusedprisoner in the bastille that one of the body so sitting in judgmenthad risen and identified him and that this man was defarge  that hereupon he had ascertained through the registers on thetable that his soninlaw was among the living prisoners and hadpleaded hard to the tribunal of whom some members were asleep andsome awake some dirty with murder and some clean some sober and somenot for his life and liberty that in the first frantic greetingslavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown systemit had been accorded to him to have charles darnay brought beforethe lawless court and examined that he seemed on the point of beingat once released when the tide in his favour met with someunexplained check not intelligible to the doctor which led to a fewwords of secret conference that the man sitting as president hadthen informed doctor manette that the prisoner must remain in custodybut should for his sake be held inviolate in safe custody thatimmediately on a signal the prisoner was removed to the interiorof the prison again but that he the doctor had then so stronglypleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that hissoninlaw was through no malice or mischance delivered to theconcourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned theproceedings that he had obtained the permission and had remainedin that hall of blood until the danger was over  the sights he had seen there with brief snatches of food andsleep by intervals shall remain untold the mad joy over theprisoners who were saved had astounded him scarcely less than the madferocity against those who were cut to pieces one prisoner there washe said who had been discharged into the street free but at whom amistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out being besoughtto go to him and dress the wound the doctor had passed out at thesame gate and had found him in the arms of a company of samaritanswho were seated on the bodies of their victims with aninconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare theyhad helped the healer and tended the wounded man with the gentlestsolicitude had made a litter for him and escorted him carefullyfrom the spot had then caught up their weapons and plunged anewinto a butchery so dreadful that the doctor had covered his eyes withhis hands and swooned away in the midst of it  as mr lorry received these confidences and as he watched theface of his friend now sixtytwo years of age a misgiving arosewithin him that such dread experiences would revive the old dangerbut he had never seen his friend in his present aspect he hadnever at all known him in his present character for the first timethe doctor felt now that his suffering was strength and power forthe first time he felt that in that sharp fire he had slowly forgedthe iron which could break the prison door of his daughtershusband and deliver him it all tended to a good end my friendit was not mere waste and ruin as my beloved child was helpful inrestoring me to myself i will be helpful now in restoring the dearestpart of herself to her by the aid of heaven i will do it thusdoctor manette and when jarvis lorry saw the kindled eyes theresolute face the calm strong look and bearing of the man whoselife always seemed to him to have been stopped like a clock for somany years and then set going again with an energy which had laindormant during the cessation of its usefulness he believed  greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend withwould have yielded before his persevering purpose while he kepthimself in his place as a physician whose business was with alldegrees of mankind bond and free rich and poor bad and good heused his personal influence so wisely that he was soon the inspectingphysician of three prisons and among them of la force he could nowassure lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone but wasmixed with the general body of prisoners he saw her husband weeklyand brought sweet messages to her straight from his lips sometimesher husband himself sent a letter to her though never by the doctorshand but she was not permitted to write to him for among themany wild suspicions of plots in the prisons the wildest of allpointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends orpermanent connections abroad  this new life of the doctors was an anxious life no doubtstill the sagacious mr lorry saw that there was a new sustainingpride in it nothing unbecoming tinged the pride it was a natural andworthy one but he observed it as a curiosity the doctor knew thatup to that time his imprisonment had been associated in the mindsof his daughter and his friend with his personal afflictiondeprivation and weakness now that this was changed and he knewhimself to be invested through that old trial with forces to whichthey both looked for charless ultimate safety and deliverance hebecame so far exalted by the change that he took the lead anddirection and required them as the weak to trust to him as thestrong the preceding relative positions of himself and lucie werereversed yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection couldreverse them for he could have had no pride but in rendering someservice to her who had rendered so much to him all curious tosee thought mr lorry in his amiably shrewd way but all naturaland right so take the lead my dear friend and keep it it couldntbe in better hands  but though the doctor tried hard and never ceased trying to getcharles darnay set at liberty or at least to get him brought totrial the public current of the time set too strong and fast for himthe new era began the king was tried doomed and beheaded therepublic of liberty equality fraternity or death declared forvictory or death against the world in arms the black flag waved nightand day from the great towers of notre dame three hundred

the brood belonging to them the doctorwalked with a steady head confident in his power cautiouslypersistent in his end never doubting that he would save lucieshusband at last yet the current of the time swept by so strong anddeep and carried the time away so fiercely that charles had lainin prison one year and three months when the doctor was thus steadyand confident so much more wicked and distracted had the revolutiongrown in that december month that the rivers of the south wereencumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night andprisoners were shot in lines and squares

cast a glance at the prisonpointed at the prison and putting his ten fingers before his faceto represent bars peeped through them jocosely  but its not my business said he and went on sawing his wood  next day he was looking out for her and accosted her the moment sheappeared  what walking here again citizeness  yes citizen  ah a child too your mother is it not my little citizeness  do i say yes mamma whispered little lucie drawing close to her  yes dearest  yes citizen  ah but its not my business my work is my business see my saw icall it my little guillotine la la la la la la and off his headcomes the billet fell as he spoke and he threw it into a basket  i call myself the samson of the firewood guillotine see hereagain loo loo loo loo loo loo and off her head comes now achild tickle tickle pickle pickle and off its head comes all thefamily  lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket but itwas impossible to be there while the woodsawyer was at work andnot be in his sight thenceforth to secure his good will shealways spoke to him first and often gave him drinkmoney which hereadily received  he was an inquisitive fellow and sometimes when she had quiteforgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates and inlifting her heart up to her husband she would come to herself to findhim looking at her with his knee on his bench and his saw stoppedin its work but its not my business he would generally say atthose times and would briskly fall to his sawing again  in all weathers in the snow and frost of winter in the bitterwinds of spring in the bot sunshine of summer in the rains ofautumn and again in the snow and frost of winter lucie passed twohours of every day at this place and every day on leaving it shekissed the prison wall her husband saw her so she learned from herfather it might be once in five or six times it might be twice orthrice running it might be not for a week or a fortnight togetherit was enough that he could and did see her when the chances servedand on that possibility she would have waited out the day sevendays a week  these occupations brought her round to the december month whereinher father walked among the terrors with a steady head on alightlysnowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner it was aday of some wild rejoicing and a festival she had seen the housesas she came along decorated with little pikes and with little redcaps stuck upon them also with tricoloured ribbons also with thestandard inscription tricoloured letters were the favouriterepublic one and indivisible liberty equality fraternity or death  the miserable shop of the woodsawyer was so small that its wholesurface furnished very indifferent space for this legend he had gotsomebody to scrawl it up for him however who had squeezed death inwith most inappropriate difficulty on his housetop he displayedpike and cap as a good citizen must and in a window he had stationedhis saw inscribed as his little sainte guillotine for the greatsharp female was by that time popularly canonised his shop was shutand he was not there which was a relief to lucie and left herquite alone  but he was not far off for presently she heard a troubled movementand a shouting coming along which filled her with fear a momentafterwards and a throng of people came pouring round the corner bythe prison wall in the midst of whom was the woodsawyer hand in handwith the vengeance there could not be fewer than five hundred peopleand they were dancing like five thousand demons there was no othermusic than their own singing they danced to the popular revolutionsong keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth inunison men and women danced together women danced together mendanced together as hazard had brought them together at first theywere a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags butas they filled the place and stopped to dance about lucie someghastly apparition of a dancefigure gone raving mad arose among themthey advanced retreated struck at one anothers hands clutched atone anothers heads spun round alone caught one another and spunround in pairs until many of them dropped while those were down therest linked hand in hand and all spun round together then the ringbroke and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turneduntil they all stopped at once began again struck clutched andtore and then reversed the spin and all spun round another waysuddenly they stopped again paused struck out the time afreshformed into lines the width of the public way and with their headslow down and their hands high up swooped screaming off no fightcould have been half so terrible as this dance it was so emphaticallya fallen sport a something once innocent delivered over to alldevilry a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the bloodbewildering the senses and steeling the heart such grace as wasvisible in it made it the uglier showing how warped and pervertedall things good by nature were become the maidenly bosom bared tothis the pretty almostchilds head thus distracted the delicatefoot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt were types of thedisjointed time  this was the carmagnole as it passed leaving lucie frightenedand bewildered in the doorway of the woodsawyers house the featherysnow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft as if it had neverbeen  o my father for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyesshe had momentarily darkened with her hand such a cruel bad sight  i know my dear i know i have seen it many times dont befrightened not one of them would harm you  i am not frightened for myself my father but when i think of myhusband and the mercies of these people  we will set him above their mercies very soon i left himclimbing to the window and i came to tell you there is no one hereto see you may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof  i do so father and i send him my soul with it  you cannot see him my poor dear  no father said lucie yearning and weeping as she kissed herhand no  a footstep in the snow madame defarge i salute youcitizeness from the doctor i salute you citizen this

propertyconfiscated and made national what he could save for the owners hesaved no better man living to hold fast by what tellsons had inkeeping and to hold his peace  a murky red and yellow sky and a rising mist from the seinedenoted the approach of darkness it was almost dark when they arrivedat the bank the stately residence of monseigneur was altogetherblighted and deserted above a heap of dust and ashes in the courtran the letters national property republic one and indivisibleliberty equality fraternity or death  who could that be with mr lorry the owner of the ridingcoatupon the chair who must not be seen from whom newly arrived didhe come out agitated and surprised to take his favourite in hisarms to whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words whenraising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the roomfrom which he had issued he said removed to the conciergerie andsummoned for tomorrow  vi  triumph  the dread tribunal of five judges public prosecutor and determinedjury sat every day their lists went forth every evening and wereread out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners thestandard gaolerjoke was come out and listen to the evening paperyou inside there  charles evremonde called darnay  so at last began the evening paper at la force  when a name was called its owner stepped apart into a spot reservedfor those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded charlesevremonde called darnay had reason to know the usage he had seenhundreds pass away so  his bloated gaoler who wore spectacles to read with glanced overthem to assure himself that he had taken his place and went throughthe list making a similar short pause at each name there weretwentythree names but only twenty were responded to for one ofthe prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten and twohad already been guillotined and forgotten the list was read inthe vaulted chamber where darnay had seen the associated prisonerson the night of his arrival every one of those had perished in themassacre every human creature he had since cared for and parted withhad died on the scaffold  there were hurried words of farewell and kindness but the partingwas soon over it was the incident of every day and the society of laforce were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits anda little concert for that evening they crowded to the grates andshed tears there but twenty places in the projected entertainmentshad to be refilled and the time was at best short to the lockuphour when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over tothe great dogs who kept watch there through the night the prisonerswere far from insensible or unfeeling their ways arose out of thecondition of the time similarly though with a subtle difference aspecies of fervour or intoxication known without doubt to haveled some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily and to dieby it was not mere boastfulness but a wild infection of the wildlyshaken public mind in seasons of pestilence some of us will have asecret attraction to the diseasea terrible passing inclination to dieof it and all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts onlyneeding circumstances to evoke them  the passage to the conciergerie was short and dark the night in itsverminhaunted cells was long and cold next day fifteen prisonerswere put to the bar before charles darnays name was called all thefifteen were condemned and the trials of the whole occupied an hourand a half  charles evremonde called darnay was at length arraigned  his judges sat upon the bench in feathered hats but the rough redcap and tricoloured cockade was the headdress otherwise prevailinglooking at the jury and the turbulent audience he might havethought that the usual order of things was reversed and that thefelons were trying the honest men the lowest cruelest and worstpopulace of a city never without its quantity of low cruel and badwere the directing spirits of the scene noisily commentingapplauding disapproving anticipating and precipitating theresult without a check of the men the greater part were armed invarious ways of the women some wore knives some daggers some ateand drank as they looked on many knitted among these last wasone with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked shewas in a front row by the side of a man whom he had never seensince his arrival at the barrier but whom he directly remembered asdefarge he noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear andthat she seemed to be his wife but what he most noticed in the twofigures was that although they were posted as close to himself asthey could be they never looked towards him they seemed to bewaiting for something with a dogged determination and they lookedat the jury but at nothing else under the president sat doctormanette in his usual quiet dress as well as the prisoner couldsee he and mr lorry were the only men there unconnected with thetribunal who wore their usual clothes and had not assumed the coarsegarb of the carmagnole  charles evremonde called darnay was accused by the publicprosecutor as an emigrant whose life was forfeit to the republicunder the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of death it wasnothing that the decree bore date since his return to france there hewas and there was the decree he had been taken in france and hishead was demanded  take off his head cried the audience an enemy to the republic  the president rang his bell to silence those cries and asked theprisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years inengland  undoubtedly it was  was he not an emigrant then what did he call himself  not an emigrant he hoped within the sense and spirit of the law  why not the president desired to know  because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distastefulto him and a station that was distasteful to him and had left hiscountry he submitted before the word emigrant in the presentacceptation by the tribunal was in use to live by his own industry inengland rather than on the industry of the overladen people offrance  what proof had he of this  he handed in the names of two witnesses theophile gabelle andalexandre manette  but he had married in england the president reminded him  true but not an english woman  a citizeness of france  yes by birth  her name and family lucie manette only daughter of doctormanette the good physician who sits there  this answer had a happy effect upon the audience cries inexaltation of the wellknown good physician rent the hall socapriciously were the people moved that tears immediately rolled downseveral ferocious countenances which had been glaring at theprisoner a moment before as if with impatience to pluck him outinto the streets and kill him  on these few steps of his dangerous way charles darnay had sethis foot according to doctor manettes reiterated instructions thesame cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him and hadprepared every inch of his road  the president asked why had he returned to france when he didand not sooner  he had not returned sooner he replied simply because he had nomeans of living in france save those he had resigned whereas inengland he lived by giving instruction in the french language andliterature he had returned when he did on the pressing and writtenentreaty of a french citizen who represented that his life wasendangered by his absence he had come back to save a citizens lifeand to bear his testimony at whatever personal hazard to thetruth was that criminal in the eyes of the republic  the populace cried enthusiastically no and the president ranghis bell to quiet them which it did not for they continued to cryno untill they left off of their own will  the president required the name of that citizen the accusedexplained that the citizen was his first witness he also referredwith confidence to the citizens letter which had been taken from himat the barrier but which he did not doubt would be found among thepapers then before the president  the doctor had taken care that it should be there had assured himthat it would be there and at this stage of the proceedings it wasproduced and read citizen gabelle was called to confirm it and didso citizen gabelle hinted with infinite delicacy and politenessthat in the pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by themultitude of enemies of the republic with which it had to deal he hadbeen slightly overlooked in his prison of the abbaye in fact hadrather passed out of the tribunals patriotic remembrance until threedays ago when he had been summoned before it and had been set atliberty on the jurys declaring themselves satisfied that theaccusation against him was answered as to himself by the surrenderof the citizen evremonde called darnay  doctor manette was next questioned his high personal popularityand the cleanness of his answers made a great impression but ashe proceeded as he showed that the accused was his first friend onhis release from his long imprisonment that the accused had remainedin england always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself intheir exile that so far from being in favour with the aristocratgovernment there he had actually been tried for his life by it asthe foe of england and friend of the united states as he broughtthese circumstances into view with the greatest discretion and withthe straightforward force of truth and earnestness the jury and thepopulace became one at last when he appealed by name to monsieurlorry an english gentleman then and there present who like himselfhad been a witness on that english trial and could corroborate hisaccount of it the jury declared that they had heard enough andthat they were ready with their votes if the president were content toreceive them  at every vote the jurymen voted aloud and individually thepopulace set up a shout of applause all the voices were in theprisoners favour and the president declared him free  then began one of those extraordinary scenes with which thepopulace sometimes gratified their fickleness or their betterimpulses towards generosity and mercy or which they regarded assome setoff against their swollen account of cruel rage no man candecide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes werereferable it is probable to a blending of all the three with thesecond predominating no sooner was the acquittal pronounced thantears were shed as freely as blood at another time and such fraternalembraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes ascould rush at him that after his long and unwholesome confinementhe was in danger of fainting from exhaustion none the less because heknew very well that the very same people carried by another currentwould have rushed at him with the very same intensity to rend himto pieces and strew him over the streets  his removal to make way for other accused persons who were to betried rescued him from these caresses for the moment five were to betried together next as enemies of the republic forasmuch as theyhad not assisted it by word or deed so quick was the tribunal tocompensate itself and the nation for a chance lost that these fivecame down to him before he left the place condemned to die withintwentyfour hours the first of them told him so with the customaryprison sign of death a raised finger and they all added in wordslong live the republic  the five had had it is true no audience to lengthen theirproceedings for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gatethere was a great crowd about it in which there seemed to be everyface he had seen in court except two for which he looked in vain onhis coming out the concourse made at him anew weeping embracingand shouting all by turns and all together until the very tide ofthe river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted seemed torun mad like the people on the shore  they put him into a great chair they had among them and whichthey had taken either out of the court itself or one of its roomsor passages over the chair they had thrown a red flag and to theback of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top in thiscar of triumph not even the doctors entreaties could prevent hisbeing carried to his home on mens shoulders with a confused sea ofred caps heaving about him and casting up to sight from the stormydeep such wrecks of faces that he more than once misdoubted hismind being in confusion and that he was in the tumbril on his wayto the guillotine  in wild dreamlike procession embracing whom they met and pointinghim out they carried him on reddening the snowy streets with theprevailing republican colour in winding and tramping through them asthey had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye theycarried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he livedher father had gone on before to prepare her and when her husbandstood upon his feet she dropped insensible in his arms  as he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head betweenhis face and the brawling crowd so that his tears and her lipsmight come together unseen a few of the people fell to dancinginstantly all the rest fell to dancing and the courtyardoverflowed with the carmagnole then they elevated into the vacantchair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the goddess ofliberty and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacentstreets and along the rivers bank and over the bridge thecarmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away  after grasping the doctors hand as he stood victorious and proudbefore him after grasping the hand of mr lorry who came pantingin breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of thecarmagnole after kissing little lucie who was lifted up to clasp herarms round his neck and after embracing the ever zealous and faithfulpross who lifted her he took his wife in his arms and carried her upto their rooms  lucie my own i am safe  o dearest charles let me thank god for this on my knees as ihave prayed to him  they all reverently bowed their heads and hearts when she was againin his arms he said to her  and now speak to your father dearest no other man in all thisfrance could have done what he has done for me  she laid her head upon her fathers breast as she had laid his poorhead on her own breast long long ago he was happy in the returnhe had made her he was recompensed for his suffering he was proud ofhis strength you must not be weak my darling he remonstrateddont tremble so i have saved him  vii  a knock at the door  i have saved him it was not another of the dreams in which he hadoften come back he was really here and yet his wife trembled anda vague but heavy fear was upon her  all the air round was so thick and dark the people were sopassionately revengeful and fitful the innocent were so constantlyput to death on vague suspicion and black malice it was so impossibleto forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear toothers as he was to her every day shared the fate from which he hadbeen clutched that her heart could not be as lightened of its load asshe felt it ought to be the shadows of the wintry afternoon werebeginning to fall and even now the dreadful carts were rollingthrough the streets her mind pursued them looking for him amongthe condemned and then she clung closer to his real presence andtrembled more  her father cheering her showed a compassionate superiority to thiswomans weakness which was wonderful to see no garret noshoemaking no one hundred and five north tower now he hadaccomplished the task he had set himself his promise was redeemed hehad saved charles let them all lean upon him  their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind not only becausethat was the safest way of life involving the least offence to thepeople but because they were not rich and charles throughout hisimprisonment had had to pay heavily for his bad food and for hisguard and towards the living of the poorer prisoners partly onthis account and partly to avoid a domestic spy they kept noservant the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at thecourtyard gate rendered them occasional service and jerry almostwholly transferred to them by mr lorry had become their dailyretainer and had his bed there every night  it was an ordinance of the republic one and indivisible ofliberty equality fraternity or death that on the door ordoorpost of every house the name of every inmate must be legiblyinscribed in letters of a certain size at a certain convenient heightfrom the ground mr jerry crunchers name therefore dulyembellished the doorpost down below and as the afternoon shadowsdeepened the owner of that name himself appeared from overlookinga painter whom doctor manette had employed to add to the list the nameof charles evremonde called darnay  in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time all theusual harmless ways of life were changed in the doctors littlehousehold as in very many others the articles of daily consumptionthat were wanted were purchased every evening in small quantities andat various small shops to avoid attracting notice and to give aslittle occasion as possible for talk and envy was the general desire  for some months past miss pross and mr cruncher had discharged theoffice of purveyors the former carrying the money the latter thebasket every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps werelighted they fared forth on this duty and made and brought home suchpurchases as were needful although miss pross through her longassociation with a french family might have known as much of theirlanguage as of her own if she had had a mind she had no mind in thatdirection consequently she knew no more of that nonsense as shewas pleased to call it than mr cruncher did so her manner ofmarketing was to plump a nounsubstantive at the head of ashopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an articleand if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted tolook round for that thing lay hold of it and hold on by it until thebargain was concluded she always made a bargain for it by holdingup as a statement of its just price one finger less than themerchant beld up whatever his number might be  now mr cruncher said miss pross whose eyes were red withfelicity if you are ready i am  jerry hoarsely professed himself at miss prosss service he hadworn all his rust off long ago but nothing would file his spikyhead down  theres all manner of things wanted said miss pross and weshall have a precious time of it we want wine among the rest nicetoasts these redheads will be drinking wherever we buy it  it will be much the same to your knowledge miss i shouldthink retorted jerry whether they drink your health or the olduns  whos he said miss pross  mr cruncher with some diffidence explained himself as meaningold nicks  ha said miss pross it doesnt need an interpreter to explainthe meaning of these creatures they have but one and its midnightmurder and mischief  hush dear pray pray be cautious cried lucie  yes yes yes ill be cautious said miss pross but i may sayamong ourselves that i do hope there will be no oniony andtobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round going on inthe streets now ladybird never you stir from that fire till icome back take care of the dear husband you have recovered and dontmove your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now till yousee me again may i ask a question doctor manette before i go  i think you may take that liberty the doctor answered smiling  for gracious sake dont talk about liberty we have quite enoughof that said miss pross  hush dear again lucie remonstrated  well my sweet said miss pross nodding her head emphaticallythe short and the long of it is that i am a subject of his mostgracious majesty king george the third miss pross curtseyed at thename and as such my maxim is confound their politics frustratetheir knavish tricks on him our hopes we fix god save the king  mr cruncher in an access of loyalty growlingly repeated the wordsafter miss pross like somebody at church  i am glad you have so much of the englishman in you though iwish you had never taken that cold in your voice said miss prossapprovingly but the question doctor manette is there it wasthe good creatures way to affect to make light of anything that was agreat anxiety with them all and to come at it in this chancemanner is there any prospect yet of our getting out of this place  i fear not yet it would be dangerous for charles yet  heighhohum said miss pross cheerfully repressing a sigh as sheglanced at her darlings golden hair in the light of the fire thenwe must have patience and wait thats all we must hold up ourheads and fight low as my brother solomon used to say now mrcruncherdont you move ladybird  they went out leaving lucie and her husband her father and thechild by a bright fire mr lorry was expected back presently fromthe banking house miss pross had lighted the lamp but had put itaside in a corner that they might enjoy the firelight undisturbedlittle lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through hisarm and he in a tone not rising much above a whisper began totell her a story of a great and powerful fairy who had opened aprisonwall and let out a captive who had once done the fairy aservice all was subdued and quiet and lucie was more at ease thanshe had been  what is that she cried all at once  my dear said her father stopping in his story and laying hishand on hers command yourself what a disordered state you are inthe least thing nothing startles you you your fathers daughter  i thought my father said lucie excusing herself with a paleface and in a faltering voice that i heard strange feet upon thestairs  my love the staircase is as still as death  as he said the word a blow was struck upon the door  oh father father what can this be hide charles save him  my child said the doctor rising and laying his hand upon hershoulder i have saved him what weakness is this my dear let me goto the door  he took the lamp in his hand crossed the two intervening outerrooms and opened it a rude clattering of feet over the floor andfour rough men in red caps armed with sabres and pistols entered theroom  the citizen evremonde called darnay said the first  who seeks him answered darnay  i seek him we seek him i know you evremonde i saw you beforethe tribunal today you are again the prisoner of the republic  the four surrounded him where he stood with his wife and childclinging to him  tell me how and why am i again a prisoner  it is enough that you return straight to the conciergerie and willknow tomorrow you are summoned for tomorrow  doctor manette whom this visitation had so turned into stonethat he stood with the lamp in his hand as if he were a statue madeto bold it moved after these words were spoken put the lamp downand confronting the speaker and taking him not ungently by theloose front of his red woollen shirt said  you know him you have said do you know me  yes i know you citizen doctor  we all know you citizen doctor said the other three  he looked abstractedly from one to another and said in a lowervoice after a pause  will you answer his question to me then how does this happen  citizen doctor said the first reluctantly he has beendenounced to the section of saint antoine this citizen pointing outthe second who had entered is from saint antoine  the citizen here indicated nodded his head and added  he is accused by saint antoine  of what asked the doctor  citizen doctor said the first with his former reluctance askno more if the republic demands sacrifices from you without doubtyou as a good patriot will be happy to make them the republic goesbefore all the people is supreme evremonde we are pressed  one word the doctor entreated will you tell me who denouncedhim  it is against rule answered the first but you can ask him ofsaint antoine here  the doctor turned his eyes upon that man who moved uneasily onhis feet rubbed his beard a little and at length said  well truly it is against rule but he is denounced and gravelyby the citizen and citizeness defarge and by one other  what other  do you ask citizen doctor  yes  then said he of saint antoine with a strange look you willbe answered tomorrow now i am dumb  viii  a hand at cards  happily unconscious of the new calamity at home miss pross threadedher way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridgeof the pontneuf reckoning in her mind the number of indispensablepurchases she had to make mr cruncher with the basket walked ather side they both looked to the right and to the left into most ofthe shops they passed had a wary eye for an gregarious assemblages ofpeople and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited groupof talkers it was a raw evening and the misty river blurred tothe eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises showedwhere the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked makingguns for the army of the republic woe to the man who played trickswith that army or got undeserved promotion in it better for him thathis beard had never grown for the national razor shaved him close  having purchased a few small articles of grocery and a measure ofoil for the lamp miss pross bethought herself of the wine theywanted after peeping into several wineshops she stopped at the signof the good republican brutus of antiquity not far from thenational palace once and twice the tuileries where the aspect ofthings rather took her fancy it had a quieter look than any otherplace of the same description they had passed and though red withpatriotic caps was not so red as the rest sounding mr cruncher andfinding him of her opinion miss pross resorted to the good republicanbrutus of antiquity attended by her cavalier  slightly observant of the smoky lights of the people pipe inmouth playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes of the onebarebreasted barearmed sootbegrimed workman reading a journalaloud and of the others listening to him of the weapons worn orlaid aside to be resumed of the two or three customers fallen forwardasleep who in the popular highshouldered shaggy black spencerlooked in that attitude like slumbering bears or dogs the twooutlandish customers approached the counter and showed what theywanted  as their wine was measuring out a man parted from another man ina corner and rose to depart in going he had to face miss prossno sooner did he face her than miss pross uttered a scream andclapped her hands  in a moment the whole company were on their feet that somebody wasassassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was thelikeliest occurrence everybody looked to see somebody fall butonly saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other the manwith all the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thoroughrepublican the woman evidently english  what was said in this disappointing anticlimax by the disciples ofthe good republican brutus of antiquity except that it wassomething very voluble and loud would have been as so much hebrewor chaldean to miss pross and her protector though they had beenall ears but they had no ears for anything in their surprise forit must be recorded that not only was miss pross lost in amazementand agitation but mr cruncher though it seemed on his own separateand individual account was in a state of the greatest wonder  what is the matter said the man who had caused miss pross toscream speaking in a vexed abrupt voice though in a low toneand in english  oh solomon dear solomon cried miss pross clapping her handsagain after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for solong a time do i find you here  dont call me solomon do you want to be the death of me askedthe man in a furtive frightened way  brother brother cried miss pross bursting into tears have iever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question  then hold your meddlesome tongue said solomon and come outif you want to speak to me pay for your wine and come out whosthis man  miss pross shaking her loving and dejected head at her by nomeans affectionate brother said through her tears mr cruncher  let him come out too said solomon does he think me a ghost  apparently mr cruncher did to judge from his looks he said not aword however and miss pross exploring the depths of her reticulethrough her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine as shedid so solomon turned to the followers of the good republicanbrutus of antiquity and offered a few words of explanation in thefrench language which caused them all to relapse into their formerplaces and pursuits  now said solomon stopping at the dark street coriner what doyou want  how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned mylove away from cried miss pross to give me such a greeting andshow me no affection  there confound it there said solomon making a dab at missprosss lips with his own now are you content  miss pross only shook her head and wept in silence  if you expect me to be surprised said her brother solomon iam not surprised i knew you were here i know of most people whoare here if you really dont want to endanger my existence which ihalf believe you do go your ways as soon as possible and let me gomine i am busy i am an official  my english brother solomon mourned miss pross casting up hertearfraught eyes that had the makings in him of one of the best andgreatest of men in his native country an official among foreignersand such foreigners i would almost sooner have seen the dear boylying in his  i said so cried her brother interrupting i knew it you wantto be the death of me i shall be rendered suspected by my ownsister just as i am getting on  the gracious and merciful heavens forbid cried miss pross farrather would i never see you again dear solomon though i have everloved you truly and ever shall say but one affectionate word tome and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us andi will detain you no longer  good miss pross as if the estrangement between them had come of anyculpability of hers as if mr lorry had not known it for a factyears ago in the quiet corner in soho that this precious brother hadspent her money and left her  he was saying the affectionate word however with a far moregrudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if theirrelative merits and positions had been reversed which is invariablythe case all the world over when mr cruncher touching him onthe shoulder hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with thefollowing singular question  i say might i ask the favour as to whether your name is johnsolomon or solomon john  the official turned towards him with sudden distrust he had notpreviously uttered a word  come said mr cruncher speak out you know which by theway was more than he could do himself john solomon or solomonjohn she calls you solomon and she must know being your sister andi know youre john you know which of the two goes first andregarding that name of pross likewise that warnt your name over thewater  what do you mean  well i dont know all i mean for i cant call to mind what yourname was over the water  no  no but ill swear it was a name of two syllables  indeed  yes tother ones was one syllable i know you you was aspywitness at the bailey what in the name of the father of liesown father to yourself was you called at that time  barsad said another voice striking in  thats the name for a thousand pound cried jerry  the speaker who struck in was sydney carton he had his handsbehind him under the skirts of his ridingcoat and he stood at mrcrunchers elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the oldbailey itself  dont be alarmed my dear miss pross i arrived at mr lorrysto his surprise yesterday evening we agreed that i would not presentmyself elsewhere until all was well or unless i could be useful ipresent myself here to beg a little talk with your brother i wishyou had a better employed brother than mr barsad i wish for yoursake mr barsad was not a sheep of the prisons  sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy under the gaolersthe spy who was pale turned paler and asked him how he dared  ill tell you said sydney i lighted on you mr barsadcoming out of the prison of the conciergerie while i was contemplatingthe walls an hour or more ago you have a face to be rememberedand i remember faces well made curious by seeing you in thatconnection and having a reason to which you are no stranger forassociating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunatei walked in your direction i walked into the wineshop here closeafter you and sat near you i had no difficulty in deducing from yourunreserved conversation and the rumour openly going about amongyour admirers the nature of your calling and gradually what i haddone at random seemed to shape itself into a purpose mr barsad  what purpose the spy asked  it would be troublesome and might be dangerous to explain inthe street could you favour me in confidence with some minutes ofyour company at the office of tellsons bank for instance  under a threat  oh did i say that  then why should i go there  really mr barsad i cant say if you cant  do you mean that you wont say sir the spy irresolutely asked  you apprehend me very clearly mr barsad i wont  cartons negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aidof his quickness and skill in such a business as he had in his secretmind and with such a man as he had to do with his practised eyesaw it and made the most of it  now i told you so said the spy casting a reproachful look athis sister if any trouble comes of this its your doing  come come mr barsad exclaimed sydney dont be ungratefulbut for my great respect for your sister i might not have led up sopleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutualsatisfaction do you go with me to the bank  ill hear what you have got to say yes ill go with you  i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner ofher own street let me take your arm miss pross this is not a goodcity at this time for you to be out in unprotected and as yourescort knows mr barsad i will invite him to mr lorrys with us arewe ready come then  miss pross recalled soon afterwards and to the end of her liferemembered that as she pressed her hands on sydneys arm and lookedup in his face imploring him to do no hurt to solomon there was abraced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes whichnot only contradicted his light manner but changed and raised theman she was too much occupied then with fears for the brother whoso little deserved her affection and with sydneys friendlyreassurances adequately to heed what she observed  they left her at the corner of the street and carton led the way tomr lorrys which was within a few minutes walk john barsad orsolomon pross walked at his side  mr lorry had just finished his dinner and was sitting before acheery little log or two of fire perhaps looking into their blaze forthe picture of that younger elderly gentleman from tellsons whohad looked into the red coals at the royal george at dover now a goodmany years ago he turned his head as they entered and showed thesurprise with which he saw a stranger  miss prosss brother sir said sydney mr barsad  barsad repeated the old gentleman barsad i have an associationwith the name and with the face  i told you you a remarkable face mr barsad observed cartoncoolly pray sit down  as he took a chair himself he supplied the link that mr lorrywanted by saying to him with a frown witness at that trial mrlorry immediately remembered and regarded his new visitor with anundisguised look of abhorrence  mr barsad has been recognised by miss pross as the affectionatebrother you have heard of said sydney and has acknowledged therelationship i pass to worse news darnay has been arrested again  struck with consternation the old gentleman exclaimed what do youtell me i left him safe and free within these two hours and am aboutto return to him  arrested for all that when was it done mr barsad  just now if at all  mr barsad is the best authority possible sir said sydneyand i have it from mr barsads communication to a friend and brothersheep over a bottle of wine that the arrest has taken place heleft the messengers at the gate and saw them admitted by theporter there is no earthly doubt that he is retaken  mr lorrys business eye read in the speakers face that it was lossof time to dwell upon the point confused but sensible that somethingmight depend on his presence of mind he commanded himself and wassilently attentive  now i trust said sydney to him that the name and influenceof doctor manette may stand him in as good stead tomorrowyou said hewould be before the tribunal again tomorrow mr barsad   yes i believe so  in as good stead tomorrow as today but it may not be so iown to you i am shaken mr lorry by doctor manettes not having hadthe power to prevent this arrest  he may not have known of it beforehand said mr lorry  but that very circumstance would be alarming when we rememberhow identified he is with his soninlaw  thats true mr lorry acknowledged with his troubled hand at hischin and his troubled eyes on carton  in short said sydney this is a desperate time when desperategames are played for desperate stakes let the doctor play the winninggame i will play the losing one no mans life here is worthpurchase any one carried home by the people today may becondemned tomorrow now the stake i have resolved to play for incase of the worst is a friend in the conciergerie and the friend ipurpose to myself to win is mr barsad  you need have good cards sir said the spy  ill ran them over ill see what i hold mr lorry you know whata brute i am i wish youd give me a little brandy  it was put before him and he drank off a glassfuldrank off anotherglassful pushed the bottle thoughtfully away  mr barsad he went on in the tone of one who really waslooking over a hand at cards sheep of the prisons emissary ofrepublican committees now turnkey now prisoner always spy andsecret informer so much the more valuable here for being english thatan englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in thosecharacters than a frenchman represents himself to his employers undera false name thats a very good card mr barsad now in the employof the republican french government was formerly in the employ of thearistocratic english government the enemy of france and freedomthats an excellent card inference clear as day in this region ofsuspicion that mr barsad still in the pay of the aristocraticenglish government is the spy of pitt the treacherous foe of therepublic crouching in its bosom the english traitor and agent ofall mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find thats a cardnot to be beaten have you followed my hand mr barsad  not to understand your play returned the spy somewhat uneasily  i play my ace denunciation of mr barsad to the nearest sectioncommittee look over your hand mr barsad and see what you havedont hurry  he drew the bottle near poured out another glassful of brandyand drank it off he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinkinghimself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him seeingit he poured out and drank another glassful  look over your hand carefully mr barsad take time  it was a poorer hand than he suspected mr barsad saw losingcards in it that sydney carton knew nothing of thrown out of hishonourable employment in england through too much unsuccessful hardswearing there not because he was not wanted there our englishreasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are ofvery modern date he knew that he had crossed the channel andaccepted service in france first as a tempter and an eavesdropperamong his own countrymen there gradually as a tempter and aneavesdropper among the natives he knew that under the overthrowngovernment he had been a spy upon saint antoine and defargeswineshop had received from the watchful police such heads ofinformation concerning doctor manettes imprisonment release andhistory as should serve him for an introduction to familiarconversation with the defarges and tried them on madame defargeand had broken down with them signally he always remembered with fearand trembling that that terrible woman had knitted when he talkedwith her and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved he hadsince seen her in the section of saint antoine over and over againproduce her knitted registers and denounce people whose lives theguillotine then surely swallowed up he knew as every one employed ashe was did that he was never safe that flight was impossible thathe was tied fast under the shadow of the axe and that in spite of hisutmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigningterror a word might bring it down upon him once denounced and onsuch grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind heforesaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character hehad seen many proofs would produce against him that fatal registerand would quash his last chance of life besides that all secret menare men soon terrified here were surely cards enough of one blacksuit to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turnedthem over  you scarcely seem to like your hand said sydney with thegreatest composure do you play  i think sir said the spy in the meanest manner as he turned tomr lorry i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolenceto put it to this other gentleman so much your junior whether he canunder any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that aceof which he has spoken i admit that i am a spy and that it isconsidered a discreditable station though it must be filled bysomebody but this gentleman is no spy and why should he so demeanhimself as to make himself one  i play my ace mr barsad said carton taking the answer onhimself and looking at his watch without any scruple in a very fewminutes  i should have hoped gentlemen both said the spy always strivingto hook mr lorry into the discussion that your respect for mysister  i could not better testify my respect for your sister than byfinally relieving her of her brother said sydney carton  you think not sir  i have thoroughly made up my mind about it  the smooth manner of the spy curiously in dissonance with hisostentatiously rough dress and probably with his usual demeanourreceived such a check from the inscrutability of carton who was amystery to wiser and honester men than he that it faltered hereand failed him while he was at a loss carton said resuming hisformer air of contemplating cards  and indeed now i think again i have a strong impression that ihave another good card here not yet enumerated that friend andfellowsheep who spoke of himself as pasturing in the countryprisons who was he  french you dont know him said the spy quickly  french eh repeated carton musing and not appearing to noticehim at all though he echoed his word well he may be  is i assure you said the spy though its not important  though its not important repeated carton in the same mechanicalway though its not important no its not important no yet iknow the face  i think not i am sure not it cant be said the spy  it cant be muttered sydney carton retrospectively andfilling his glass which fortunately was a small one again cantbe spoke good french yet like a foreigner i thought  provincial said the spy  no foreign cried carton striking his open hand on the table asa light broke clearly on his mind cly disguised but the sameman we had that man before us at the old bailey  now there you are hasty sir said barsad with a smile that gavehis aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side there youreally give me an advantage over you cly who i will unreservedlyadmit at this distance of time was a partner of mine has beendead several years i attended him in his last illness he wasburied in london at the church of saint pancrasinthefields hisunpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment preventedmy following his remains but i helped to lay him in his coffin  here mr lorry became aware from where he sat of a mostremarkable goblin shadow on the wall tracing it to its source hediscovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising andstiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on mr crunchers head  let us be reasonable said the spy and let us be fair to showyou how mistaken you are and what an unfounded assumption yours is iwill lay before you a certificate of clys burial which i happened tohave carried in my pocketbook with a hurried hand he produced andopened it ever since there it is oh look at it look at it youmay take it in your hand its no forgery  here mr lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongateand mr cruncher rose and stepped forward his hair could not havebeen more violently on end if it had been that moment dressed bythe cow with the crumpled horn in the house that jack built  unseen by the spy mr cruncher stood at his side and touched himon the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff  that there roger cly master said mr cruncher with a taciturnand ironbound visage so you put him in his coffin  i did  who took him out of it  barsad leaned back in his chair and stammered what do you mean  i mean said mr cruncher that he warnt never in it no nothe ill have my head took off if he was ever in it  the spy looked round at the two gentlemen they both looked inunspeakable astonishment at jerry  i tell you said jerry that you buried pavingstones and earthin that there coffin dont go and tell me that you buried cly it wasa take in me and two more knows it  how do you know it  whats that to you ecod growled mr cruncher its you i havegot a old grudge again is it with your shameful impositions upontradesmen id catch hold of your throat and choke you for half aguinea  sydney carton who with mr lorry had been lost in amazement atthis turn of the business here requested mr cruncher to moderate andexplain himself  at another time sir he returned evasively the present time isillconwenient for explainin what i stand to is that he knowswell wot that there cly was never in that there coffin let him say hewas in so much as a word of one syllable and ill either catchhold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea mr cruncherdwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer or ill out and announcehim  humph i see one thing said carton i hold another card mrbarsad impossible here in raging paris with suspicion filling theair for you to outlive denunciation when you are in communicationwith another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourselfwho moreover has the mystery about him of having feigned death andcome to life again a plot in the prisons of the foreigner againstthe republic a strong card a certain guillotine card do you play  no returned the spy i throw up i confess that we were sounpopular with the outrageous mob that i only got away from englandat the risk of being ducked to death and that cly was so ferretedup and down that he never would have got away at all but for thatsham though how this man knows it was a sham is a wonder ofwonders to me  never you trouble your head about this man retorted thecontentious mr cruncher youll have trouble enough with giving yourattention to that gentleman and look here once more mrcruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatiousparade of his liberality id catch hold of your throat and choke youfor half a guinea  the sheep of the prisons turned from him to sydney carton and saidwith more decision it has come to a point i go on duty soon andcant overstay my time you told me you had a proposal what is itnow it is of no use asking too much of me ask me to do anything inmy office putting my head in great extra danger and i had bettertrust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consentin short i should make that choice you talk of desperation we areall desperate here remember i may denounce you if i think properand i can swear my way through stone walls and so can others nowwhat do you want with me  not very much you are a turnkey at the conciergerie  i tell you once for all there is no such thing as an escapepossible said the spy firmly  why need you tell me what i have not asked you are a turnkey atthe conciergerie  i am sometimes  you can be when you choose  i can pass in and out when i choose  sydney carton filled another glass with brandy poured it slowly outupon the hearth and watched it as it dropped it being all spenthe said rising  so far we have spoken before these two because it was as wellthat the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you andme come into the dark room here and let us have one final wordalone  ix  the game made  while sydney carton and the sheep of the prisons were in theadjoining dark room speaking so low that not a sound was heard mrlorry looked at jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust thathonest tradesmans manner of receiving the look did not inspireconfidence he changed the leg on which he rested as often as if hehad fifty of those limbs and were trying them all he examined hisfingernails with a very questionable closeness of attention andwhenever mr lorrys eye caught his he was taken with that peculiarkind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it which isseldom if ever known to be an infirmity attendant on perfectopenness of character  jerry said mr lorry come here  mr cruncher came forward sideways with one of his shoulders inadvance of him  what have you been besides a messenger  after some cogitation accompanied with an intent look at hispatron mr cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replyingagricultooral character  my mind misgives me much said mr lorry angrily shaking aforefinger at him that you have used the respectable and great houseof tellsons as a blind and that you have had an unlawfuloccupation of an infamous description if you have dont expect me tobefriend you when you get back to england if you have dont expectme to keep your secret tellsons shall not be imposed upon  i hope sir pleaded the abashed mr cruncher that a gentlemanlike yourself wot ive had the honour of odd jobbing till im greyat it would think twice about harming of me even if it wos so idont say it is but even if it wos and which it is to be took intoaccount that if it wos it wouldnt even then be all o one sidethered be two sides to it there might be medical doctors at thepresent hour a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesmandont pick up his fardens fardens no nor yet his half fardens halffardens no nor yet his quarter a banking away like smoke attellsons and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on thesly a going in and going out to their own carriages ah equally likesmoke if not more so well that ud be imposing too ontellsons for you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander andheres mrs cruncher or leastways wos in the old england times andwould be tomorrow if cause given a floppin again the business tothat degree as is ruinatingstark ruinating whereas them medicaldoctors wives dont flop catch em at it or if they flop theirfloppings goes in favour of more patients and how can you rightlyhave one without tother then wot with undertakers and wot withparish clerks and wot with sextons and wot with private watchmenall awaricious and all in it a man wouldnt get much by it even ifit wos so and wot little a man did get would never prosper with himmr lorry hed never have no good of it hed want all along to beout of the line if he could see his way but being once in even ifit wos so  ugh cried mr lorry rather relenting nevertheless i amshocked at the sight of you  now what i would humbly offer to you sir pursued mrcruncher even if it wos so which i dont say it is  dont prevaricate said mr lorry  no i will not sir returned mr cruncher as if nothing werefurther from his thoughts or practice which i dont say it is wot iwould humbly offer to you sir would be this upon that therestool at that there bar sets that there boy of mine brought upand growed up to be a man wot will errand you message yougenerallightjob you till your heels is where your head is ifsuch should be your wishes if it wos so which i still dont say itis for i will not prevaricate to you sir let that there boy keephis fathers place and take care of his mother dont blow uponthat boys father do not do it sir and let that father go intothe line of the reglar diggin and make amends for what he wouldhave undug if it wos so by diggin of em in with a will and withconwictions respectin the futur keepin of em safe that mrlorry said mr cruncher wiping his forehead with his arm as anannouncement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourseis wot i would respectfully offer to you sir a man dont see allthis here a goin on dreadful round him in the way of subjectswithout heads dear me plentiful enough fur to bring the price downto porterage and hardly that without havin his serious thoughts ofthings and these here would be mine if it wos so entreatin ofyou fur to bear in mind that wot i said just now i up and said in thegood cause when i might have kep it back  that at least is true said mr lorry say no more now it may bethat i shall yet stand your friend if you deserve it and repent inaction not in words i want no more words  mr cruncher knuckled his forehead as sydney carton and the spyreturned from the dark room adieu mr barsad said the former ourarrangement thus made you have nothing to fear from me  he sat down in a chair on the hearth over against mr lorry whenthey were alone mr lorry asked him what he had done  not much if it should go ill with the prisoner i have ensuredaccess to him once  mr lorrys countenance fell  it is all i could do said carton to propose too much wouldbe to put this mans head under the axe and as he himself saidnothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced it wasobviously the weakness of the position there is no help for it  but access to him said mr lorry if it should go ill before thetribunal will not save him  i never said it would  mr lorrys eyes gradually sought the fire his sympathy with hisdarling and the heavy disappointment of his second arrestgradually weakened them he was an old man now overborne with anxietyof late and his tears fell  you are a good man and a true friend said carton in an alteredvoice forgive me if i notice that you are affected i could notsee my father weep and sit by careless and i could not respect yoursorrow more if you were my father you are free from that misfortunehowever  though he said the last words with a slip into his usual mannerthere was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in histouch that mr lorry who had never seen the better side of himwas wholly unprepared for he gave him his hand and carton gentlypressed it  to return to to poor darnay said carton dont tell her ofthis interview or this arrangement it would not enable her to goto see him she might think it was contrived in case of the worse toconvey to him the means of anticipating the sentence  mr lorry had not thought of that and he looked quickly at cartonto see if it were in his mind it seemed to be he returned thelook and evidently understood it  she might think a thousand things carton said and any of themwould only add to her trouble dont speak of me to her as i saidto you when i first came i had better not see her i can put myhand out to do any little helpful work for her that my hand canfind to do without that you are going to her i hope she must bevery desolate tonight  i am going now directly  i am glad of that she has such a strong attachment to you andreliance on you how does she look  anxious and unhappy but very beautiful  ah  it was a long grieving sound like a sigh almost like a sob itattracted mr lorrys eyes to cartons face which was turned to thefire a light or a shade the old gentleman could not have saidwhich passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over ahillside on a wild bright day and he lifted his foot to put back oneof the little flaming logs which was tumbling forward he wore thewhite ridingcoat and topboots then in vogue and the light of thefire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale with hislong brown hair all untrimmed hanging loose about him hisindifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word ofremonstrance from mr lorry his boot was still upon the hot embers ofthe flaming log when it had broken under the weight of his foot  i forgot it he said  mr lorrys eyes were again attracted to his face taking note ofthe wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features andhaving the expression of prisoners faces fresh in his mind he wasstrongly reminded of that expression  and your duties here have drawn to an end sir said cartonturning to him  yes as i was telling you last night when ucie came in sounexpectedly i have at length done all that i can do here i hoped tohave left them in perfect safety and then to have quitted paris ihave my leave to pass i was ready to go  they were both silent  yours is a long life to look back upon sir said cartonwistfully  i am in my seventyeighth year  you have been useful all your life steadily and constantlyoccupied trusted respected and looked up to  i have been a man of business ever since i have been a manindeed i may say that i was a man of business when a boy  see what a place you fill at seventyeight how many people willmiss you when you leave it empty  a solitary old bachelor answered mr lorry shaking his headthere is nobody to weep for me  how can you say that wouldnt she weep for you wouldnt herchild  yes yes thank god i didnt quite mean what i said  it is a thing to thank god for is it not  surely surely  if you could say with truth to your own solitary heart tonighti have secured to myself the love and attachment the gratitude orrespect of no human creature i have won myself a tender place inno regard i have done nothing good or serviceable to be rememberedby your seventyeight years would be seventyeight heavy curseswould they not  you say truly mr carton i think they would be  sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire and after a silenceof a few moments said  i should like to ask you does your childhood seem far off do thedays when you sat at your mothers knee seem days of very long ago  responding to his softened manner mr lorry answered  twenty years back yes at this time of my life no for as i drawcloser and closer to the end i travel in the circle nearer andnearer to the beginning it seems to be one of the kind smoothings andpreparings of the way my heart is touched now by many remembrancesthat had long fallen asleep of my pretty young mother and i soold and by many associations of the days when what we call theworld was not so real with me and my faults were not confirmed inme  i understand the feeling exclaimed carton with a bright flushand you are the better for it  i hope so  carton terminated the conversation here by rising to help him onwith his outer coat but you said mr lorry reverting to thetheme you are young  yes said carton i am not old but my young way was never theway to age enough of me  and of me i am sure said mr lorry are you going out  ill walk with you to her gate you know my vagabond and restlesshabits if i should prowl about the streets a long time dont beuneasy i shall reappear in the morning you go to the courttomorrow  yes unhappily  i shall be there but only as one of the crowd my spy will finda place for me take my arm sir  mr lorry did so and they went downstairs and out in thestreets a few minutes brought them to mr lorrys destination cartonleft him there but lingered at a little distance and turned backto the gate again when it was shut and touched it he had heard ofher going to the prison every day she came out here he saidlooking about him turned this way must have trod on these stonesoften let me follow in her steps  it was ten oclock at night when he stood before the prison of laforce where she had stood hundreds of times a little woodsawyerhaving closed his shop was smoking his pipe at his shopdoor  good night citizen said sydney carton pausing in going by forthe man eyed him inquisitively  good night citizen  how goes the republic  you mean the guillotine not ill sixtythree today we shallmount to a hundred soon samson and his men complain sometimes ofbeing exhausted ha ha ha he is so droll that samson such abarber  do you often go to see him  shave always every day what a barber you have seen him atwork  never  go and see him when he has a good batch figure this to yourselfcitizen he shaved the sixtythree today in less than two pipesless than two pipes word of honour  as the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking toexplain how he timed the executioner carton was so sensible of arising desire to strike the life out of him that he turned away  but you are not english said the woodsawyer though you wearenglish dress  yes said carton pausing again and answering over his shoulder  you speak like a frenchman  i am an old student here  aha a perfect frenchman good night englishman  good night citizen  but go and see that droll dog the little man persisted callingafter him and take a pipe with you  sydney had not gone far out of sight when he stopped in themiddle of the street under a glimmering lamp and wrote with hispencil on a scrap of paper then traversing with the decided stepof one who remembered the way well several dark and dirty streetsmuch dirtier than usual for the best public thoroughfares remaineduncleansed in those times of terrorhe stopped at a chemists shopwhich the owner was closing with his own hands a small dimcrooked shop kept in a tortuous uphill thoroughfare by a smalldim crooked man  giving this citizen too good night as he confronted him at hiscounter he laid the scrap of paper before him whew the chemistwhistled softly as he read it hi hi hi  sydney carton took no heed and the chemist said  for you citizen  for me  you will be careful to keep them separate citizen you know theconsequences of mixing them  perfectly  certain small packets were made and given to him he put them oneby one in the breast of his inner coat counted out the money forthem and deliberately left the shop there is nothing more to dosaid he glancing upward at the moon until tomorrow i cantsleep  it was not a reckless manner the manner in which he said thesewords aloud under the fastsailing clouds nor was it moreexpressive of negligence than defiance it was the settled manner of atired man who had wandered and struggled and got lost but who atlength struck into his road and saw its end  long ago when he had been famous among his earliest competitorsas a youth of great promise he had his father to the grave hismother had died years before these solemn words which had been readat his fathers grave arose in his mind as he went down the darkstreets among the heavy shadows with the moon and the clouds sailingon high above him i am the resurrection and the life saith thelord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he liveand whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die  in a city dominated by the axe alone at night with naturalsorrow rising in him for the sixtythree who had been that day putto death and for tomorrows victims then awaiting their doom inthe prisons and still of tomorrows and tomorrows the chain ofassociation that brought the words home like a rusty old shipsanchor from the deep might have been easily found he did not seekit but repeated them and went on  with a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the peoplewere going to rest forgetful through a few calm hours of thehorrors surrounding them in the towers of the churches where noprayers were said for the popular revulsion had even travelled thatlength of selfdestruction from years of priestly impostorsplunderers and profligates in the distant burialplaces reservedas they wrote upon the gates for eternal sleep in the aboundinggaols and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a deathwhich had become so common and material that no sorrowful story ofa haunting spirit ever arose among the people out of all the workingof the guillotine with a solemn interest in the whole life anddeath of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in furysydney carton crossed the seine again for the lighter streets  few coaches were abroad for riders in coaches were liable to besuspected and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps and put onheavy shoes and trudged but the theatres were all well filledand the people poured cheerfully out as he passed and went chattinghome at one of the theatre doors there was a little girl with amother looking for a way across the street through the mud hecarried the child over and before the timid arm was loosed from hisneck asked her for a kiss  i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he thatbelieveth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoeverliveth and believeth in me shall never die  now that the streets were quiet and the night wore on the wordswere in the echoes of his feet and were in the air perfectly calmand steady he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked buthe heard them always  the night wore out and as he stood upon the bridge listening tothe water as it splashed the riverwalls of the island of paris wherethe picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright inthe light of the moon the day came coldly looking like a dead faceout of the sky then the night with the moon and the stars turnedpale and died and for a little while it seemed as if creation weredelivered over to deaths dominion  but the glorious sun rising seemed to strike those words thatburden of the night straight and warm to his heart in its long brightrays and looking along them with reverently shaded eyes a bridge oflight appeared to span the air between him and the sun while theriver sparkled under it  the strong tide so swift so deep and certain was like acongenial friend in the morning stillness he walked by the streamfar from the houses and in the light and warmth of the sun fellasleep on the bank when he awoke and was afoot again he lingeredthere yet a little longer

unfortunate physician native of beauvaisand afterwards resident in paris write this melancholy paper in mydoleful cell in the bastille during the last month of the year i write it at stolen intervals under every difficulty i design tosecrete it in the wall of the chimney where i have slowly andlaboriously made a place of concealment for it some pitying handmay find it there when i and my sorrows are dust  these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i writewith difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimneymixed with blood in the last month of the tenth year of my captivityhope has quite departed from my breast i know from terriblewarnings i have noted in myself that my reason will not long remainunimpaired but i solemnly declare that i am at this time in thepossession of my right mind that my memory is exact andcircumstantial and that i write the truth as i shall answer for thesemy last recorded words whether they be ever read by men or not atthe eternal judgmentseat  one cloudy moonlight night in the third week of december ithink the twentysecond of the month in the year  i waswalking on a retired part of the quay by the seine for the refreshmentof the frosty air at an hours distance from my place of residence inthe street of the school of medicine when a carriage came alongbehind me driven very fast as i stood aside to let that carriagepass apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down a head was putout at the window and a voice called to the driver to stop  the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in hishorses and the same voice called to me by my name i answered thecarriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen hadtime to open the door and alight before i came up with it iobserved that they were both wrapped in cloaks and appeared toconceal themselves as they stood side by side near the carriage doori also observed that they both looked of about my own age or ratheryounger and that they were greatly alike in stature mannervoice and as far as i could see face too  you are doctor manette said one  i am  doctor manette formerly of beauvais said the other theyoung physician originally an expert surgeon who within the lastyear or two has made a rising reputation in paris  gentlemen i returned i am that doctor manette of whom youspeak so graciously  we have been to your residence said the first and not being sofortunate as to find you there and being informed that you wereprobably walking in this direction we followed in the hope ofovertaking you will you please to enter the carriage  the manner of both was imperious and they both moved as thesewords were spoken so as to place me between themselves and thecarriage door they were armed i was not  gentlemen said i pardon me but i usually inquire who doesme the honour to seek my assistance and what is the nature of thecase to which i am summoned  the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second doctoryour clients are people of condition as to the nature of the caseour confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it foryourself better than we can describe it enough will you please toenter the carriage  i could do nothing but comply and i entered it in silence theyboth entered after me the last springing in after putting up thesteps the carriage turned about and drove on at its former speed  i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred i have nodoubt that it is word for word the same i describe everythingexactly as it took place constraining my mind not to wander fromthe task where i make the broken marks that follow here i leaveoff for the time and put my paper in its hidingplace      the carriage left the streets behind passed the north barrier andemerged upon the country road at twothirds of a league from thebarrier i did not estimate the distance at that time butafterwards when i traversed it it struck out of the main avenueand presently stopped at a solitary house we all three alightedand walked by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglectedfountain had overflowed to the door of the house it was not openedimmediately in answer to the ringing of the bell and one of my twoconductors struck the man who opened it with his heavy ridingglove across the face  there was nothing in this action to attract my particularattention for i had seen common people struck more commonly thandogs but the other of the two being angry likewise struck theman in like manner with his arm the look and bearing of thebrothers were then so exactly alike that i then first perceivedthem to be twin brothers  from the time of our alighting at the outer gate which we foundlocked and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us andhad relocked i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber iwas conducted to this chamber straight the cries growing louder as weascended the stairs and i found a patient in a high fever of thebrain lying on a bed  the patient was a woman of great beauty and young assuredly notmuch past twenty her hair was torn and ragged and her arms werebound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs i noticed that thesebonds were all portions of a gentlemans dress on one of themwhich was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony i saw thearmorial bearings of a noble and the letter e  i saw this within the first minute of my contemplation of thepatient for in her restless strivings she had turned over on herface on the edge of the bed had drawn the end of the scarf into hermouth and was in danger of suffocation my first act was to put outmy hand to relieve her breathing and in moving the scarf aside theembroidery in the corner caught my sight  i turned her gently over placed my hands upon her breast to calmher and keep her down and looked into her face her eyes were dilatedand wild and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks and repeatedthe words my husband my father and my brother and then countedup to twelve and said hush for an instant and no more she wouldpause to listen and then the piercing shrieks would begin againand she would repeat the cry my husband my father and my brotherand would count up to twelve and say hush there was novariation in the order or the manner there was no cessation but theregular moments pause in the utterance of these sounds  how long i asked has this lasted  to distinguish the brothers i will call them the elder and theyounger by the elder i mean him who exercised the most authority itwas the elder who replied since about this hour last night  she has a husband a father and a brother  a brother  i do not address her brother  he answered with great contempt no  she has some recent association with the number twelve  the younger brother impatiently rejoined with twelve oclock  see gentlemen said i still keeping my hands upon her breasthow useless i am as you have brought me if i had known what i wascoming to see i could have come provided as it is time must belost there are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place  the elder brother looked to the younger who said haughtily thereis a case of medicines here and brought it from a closet and put iton the table      i opened some of the bottles smelt them and put the stoppers tomy lips if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicinesthat were poisons in themselves i would not have administered anyof those  do you doubt them asked the younger brother  you see monsieur i am going to use them i replied and said nomore  i made the patient swallow with great difficulty and after manyefforts the dose that i desired to give as i intended to repeat itafter a while and as it was necessary to watch its influence ithen sat down by the side of the bed there was a timid and suppressedwoman in attendance wife of the man downstairs who had retreatedinto a corner the house was damp and decayed indifferentlyfurnished evidently recently occupied and temporarily used somethick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows to deadenthe sound of the shrieks they continued to be uttered in theirregular succession with the cry my husband my father and mybrother the counting up to twelve and hush the frenzy was soviolent that i had not unfastened the bandages restraining thearms but i had looked to them to see that they were not painfulthe only spark of encouragement in the case was that my hand uponthe sufferers breast had this much soothing influence that forminutes at a time it tranquillised the figure it had no effect uponthe cries no pendulum could be more regular  for the reason that my hand had this effect i assume i had satby the side of the bed for half an hour with the two brothers lookingon before the elder said  there is another patient  i was startled and asked is it a pressing case  you had better see he carelessly answered and took up alight      the other patient lay in a back room across a second staircasewhich was a species of loft over a stable there was a low plasteredceiling to a part of it the rest was open to the ridge of thetiled roof and there were beams across hay and straw were storedin that portion of the place fagots for firing and a heap ofapples in sand i had to pass through that part to get at theother my memory is circumstantial and unshaken i try it with thesedetails and i see them all in this my cell in the bastille near theclose of the tenth year of my captivity as i saw them all that night  on some hay on the ground with a cushion thrown under his headlay a handsome peasant boy a boy of not more than seventeen at themost he lay on his back with his teeth set his right handclenched on his breast and his glaring eyes looking straightupward i could not see where his wound was as i kneeled on oneknee over him but i could see that he was dying of a wound from asharp point  i am a doctor my poor fellow said i let me examine it  i do not want it examined he answered let it be  it was under his hand and i soothed him to let me move his handaway the wound was a swordthrust received from twenty totwentyfour hours before but no skill could have saved him if ithad been looked to without delay he was then dying fast as iturned my eyes to the elder brother i saw him looking down at thishandsome boy whose life was ebbing out as if he were a woundedbird or hare or rabbit not at all as if he were a fellowcreature  how has this been done monsieur said i  a crazed young common dog a serf forced my brother to drawupon him and has fallen by my brothers sword like a gentleman  there was no touch of pity sorrow or kindred humanity in thisanswer the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenientto have that different order of creature dying there and that itwould have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routineof his vermin kind he was quite incapable of any compassionatefeeling about the boy or about his fate  the boys eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken and theynow slowly moved to me  doctor they are very proud these nobles but we common dogsare proud too sometimes they plunder us outrage us beat us killus but we have a little pride left sometimes she have you seenher doctor  the shrieks and the cries were audible there though subdued by thedistance he referred to them as if she were lying in our presence  i said i have seen her  she is my sister doctor they have had their shameful rightsthese nobles in the modesty and virtue of our sisters many yearsbut we have had good girls among us i know it and have heard myfather say so she was a good girl she was betrothed to a goodyoung man too a tenant of his we were all tenants of his thatmans who stands there the other is his brother the worst of a badrace  it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodilyforce to speak but his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis  we were so robbed by that man who stands there as all we commondogs are by those superior beings taxed by him without mercy obligedto work for him without pay obliged to grind our corn at his millobliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops andforbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own pinagedand plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit ofmeat we ate it in fear with the door barred and the shutters closedthat his people should not see it and take it from us i say wewere so robbed and hunted and were made so poor that our fathertold us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world andthat what we should most pray for was that our women might be barrenand our miserable race die out  i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed burstingforth like a fire i had supposed that it must be latent in the peoplesomewhere but i had never seen it break out until i saw it in thedying boy  nevertheless doctor my sister married he was ailing at thattime poor fellow and she married her lover that she might tendand comfort him in our cottage our doghut as that man would callit she had not been married many weeks when that mans brother sawher and admired her and asked that man to lend her to him for whatare husbands among us he was willing enough but my sister was goodand virtuous and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as minewhat did the two then to persuade her husband to use his influencewith her to make her willing  the boys eyes which had been fixed on mine slowly turned tothe lookeron and i saw in the two faces that all he said was truethe two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another i can seeeven in this bastille the gentlemans all negligent indifferencethe peasants all troddendown sentiment and passionate revenge  you know doctor that it is among the rights of these nobles toharness us common dogs to carts and drive us they so harnessed himand drove him you know that it is among their rights to keep us intheir grounds all night quieting the frogs in order that their noblesleep may not be disturbed they kept him out in the unwholesome mistsat night and ordered him back into his harness in the day but he wasnot persuaded no taken out of harness one day at noon to feed ifhe could find food he sobbed twelve times once for every stroke ofthe bell and died on her bosom  nothing human could have beld life in the boy but his determinationto tell all his wrong he forced back the gathering shadows ofdeath as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched and tocover his wound  then with that mans permission and even with his aid hisbrother took her away in spite of what i know she must have toldhis brother and what that is will not be long unknown to youdoctor if it is now his brother took her away for his pleasureand diversion for a little while i saw her pass me on the road wheni took the tidings home our fathers heart burst he never spokeone of the words that filled it i took my young sister for i haveanother to a place beyond the reach of this man and where at leastshe will never be his vassal then i tracked the brother here andlast night climbed in a common dog but sword in hand where isthe loft window it was somewhere here  the room was darkening to his sight the world was narrowing aroundhim i glanced about me and saw that the hay and straw weretrampled over the floor as if there had been a struggle  she heard me and ran in i told her not to come near us till hewas dead he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money thenstruck at me with a whip but i though a common dog so struck at himas to make him draw let him break into as many pieces as he will thesword that he stained with my common blood he drew to defend himselfthrust at me with all his skill for his life  my glance had fallen but a few moments before on the fragments ofa broken sword lying among the hay that weapon was a gentlemans inanother place lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldiers  now lift me up doctor lift me up where is he  he is not here i said supporting the boy and thinking thathe referred to the brother  he proud as these nobles are he is afraid to see me where isthe man who was here turn my face to him  i did so raising the boys head against my knee but invested forthe moment with extraordinary power he raised himself completelyobliging me to rise too or i could not have still supported him  marquis said the boy turned to him with his eyes opened wideand his right hand raised in the days when all these things are tobe answered for i summon you and yours to the last of your bad raceto answer for them i mark this cross of blood upon you as a signthat i do it in the days when all these things are to be answeredfor i summon your brother the worst of the bad race to answer forthem separately i mark this cross of blood upon him as a sign that ido it  twice he put his hand to the wound in his breast and with hisforefinger drew a cross in the air he stood for an instant with thefinger yet raised and as it dropped he dropped with it and i laidhim down dead      when i returned to the bedside of the young woman i found herraving in precisely the same order of continuity i knew that thismight last for many hours and that it would probably end in thesilence of the grave  i repeated the medicines i had given her and i sat at the sideof the bed until the night was far advanced she never abated thepiercing quality of her shrieks never stumbled in the distinctness orthe order of her words they were always my husband my father andmy brother one two three four five six seven eight nine teneleven twelve hush  this lasted twentysix hours from the time when i first saw heri had come and gone twice and was again sitting by her when shebegan to falter i did what little could be done to assist thatopportunity and byandbye she sank into a lethargy and lay like thedead  it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last after a long andfearful storm i released her arms and called the woman to assistme to compose her figure and the dress she had torn it was thenthat i knew her condition to be that of one in whom the firstexpectations of being a mother have arisen and it was then that ilost the little hope i had had of her  is she dead asked the marquis whom i will still describe as theelder brother coming booted into the room from his horse  not dead said i but like to die  what strength there is in these common bodies he said lookingdown at her with some curiosity  there is prodigious strength i answered him in sorrow anddespair  he first laughed at my words and then frowned at them he moveda chair with his foot near to mine ordered the woman away and saidin a subdued voice  doctor finding my brother in this difficulty with these hindsi recommended that your aid should be invited your reputation ishigh and as a young man with your fortune to make you areprobably mindful of your interest ile things that you see here arethings to be seen and not spoken of  i listened to the patients breathing and avoided answering  do you honour me with your attention doctor  monsieur said i in my profession the communications ofpatients are always received in confidence i was guarded in myanswer for i was troubled in my mind with what i had heard and seen  her breathing was so difficult to trace that i carefully tried thepulse and the heart there was life and no more looking round as iresumed my seat i found both the brothers intent upon me      i write with so much difficulty the cold is so severe i am sofearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell andtotal darkness that i must abridge this narrative there is noconfusion or failure in my memory it can recall and could detailevery word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers  she lingered for a week towards the last i could understandsome few syllables that she said to me by placing my ear close to herlips she asked me where she was and i told her who i was and itold her it was in vain that i asked her for her family name shefaintly shook her head upon the pillow and kept her secret as theboy had done  i had no opportunity of asking her any question until i had toldthe brothers she was sinking fast and could not live another dayuntil then though no one was ever presented to her consciousness savethe woman and myself one or other of them had always jealously satbehind the curtain at the head of the bed when i was there but whenit came to that they seemed careless what communication i mighthold with her as if the thought passed through my mind i were dyingtoo  i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the youngerbrothers as i call him having crossed swords with a peasant andthat peasant a boy the only consideration that appeared to affect themind of either of them was the consideration that this was highlydegrading to the family and was ridiculous as often as i caughtthe younger brothers eyes their expression reminded me that hedisliked me deeply for knowing what i knew from the boy he wassmoother and more polite to me than the elder but i saw this ialso saw that i was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder too  my patient died two hours before midnight at a time by my watchanswering almost to the minute when i had first seen her i wasalone with her when her forlorn young head drooped gently on oneside and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended  the brothers were waiting in a room downstairs impatient toride away i had heard them alone at the bedside striking theirboots with their ridingwhips and loitering up and down  at last she is dead said the elder when i went in  she is dead said i  i congratulate you my brother were his words as he turnedround  he had before offered me money which i had postponed taking henow gave me a rouleau of gold i took it from his hand but laid it onthe table i had considered the question and had resolved to acceptnothing  pray excuse me said i under the circumstances no  they exchanged looks but bent their heads to me as i bent mineto them and we parted without another word on either side      i am weary weary weary worn down by misery i cannot read what ihave written with this gaunt hand  early in the morning the rouleau of gold was left at my door ina little box with my name on the outside from the first i hadanxiously considered what i ought to do i decided that day to writeprivately to the minister stating the nature of the two cases towhich i had been summoned and the place to which i had gone ineffect stating all the circumstances i knew what court influencewas and what the immunities of the nobles were and i expected thatthe matter would never be heard of but i wished to relieve my ownmind i had kept the matter a profound secret even from my wifeand this too i resolved to state in my letter i had no apprehensionwhatever of my real danger but i was conscious that there might bedanger for others if others were compromised by possessing theknowledge that i possessed  i was much engaged that day and could not complete my letterthat night i rose long before my usual time next morning to finishit it was the last day of the year the letter was lying before mejust completed when i was told that a lady waited who wished tosee me       i am growing more and more unequal to the task i have setmyself it is so cold so dark my senses are so benumbed and thegloom upon me is so dreadful  the lady was young engaging and handsome but not marked for longlife she was in great agitation she presented herself to me as thewife of the marquis st evremonde i connected the title by whichthe boy had addressed the elder brother with the initial letterembroidered on the scarf and had no difficulty in arriving at theconclusion that i had seen that nobleman very lately  my memory is still accurate but i cannot write the words of ourconversation i suspect that i am watched more closely than i was andi know not at what times i may be watched she had in partsuspected and in part discovered the main facts of the cruelstory of her husbands share in it and my being resorted to she didnot know that the girl was dead her hope had been she said ingreat distress to show her in secret a womans sympathy her hopehad been to avert the wrath of heaven from a house that had longbeen hateful to the suffering many  she had reasons for believing that there was a young sister livingand her greatest desire was to help that sister i could tell hernothing but that there was such a sister beyond that i knew nothingher inducement to come to me relying on my confidence had been thehope that i could tell her the name and place of abode whereas tothis wretched hour i am ignorant of both      these scraps of paper fail me one was taken from me with awarning yesterday i must finish my record today  she was a good compassionate lady and not happy in hermarriage how could she be the brother distrusted and disliked herand his influence was all opposed to her she stood in dread of himand in dread of her husband too when i handed her down to the doorthere was a child a pretty boy from two to three years old in hercarriage  for his sake doctor she said pointing to him in tears iwould do all i can to make what poor amends i can he will neverprosper in his inheritance otherwise i have a presentiment that if noother innocent atonement is made for this it will one day be requiredof him what i have left to call my own it is little beyond the worthof a few jewelsi will make it the first charge of his life to bestowwith the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother on thisinjured family if the sister can be discovered  she kissed the boy and said caressing him it is for thine owndear sake thou wilt be faithful little charles the childanswered her bravely yes i kissed her hand and she took him inher arms and went away caressing him i never saw her more  as she had mentioned her husbands name in the faith that i knewit i added no mention of it to my letter i sealed my letter andnot trusting it out of my own hands delivered it myself that day  that night the last night of the year towards nine oclock a manin a black dress rang at my gate demanded to see me and softlyfollowed my servant ernest defarge a youth upstairs when myservant came into the room where i sat with my wife o my wifebeloved of my heart my fair young english wife we saw the manwho was supposed to be at the gate standing silent behind him  an urgent case in the rue st honore he said it would notdetain me he had a coach in waiting  it brought me here it brought me to my grave when i was clearof the house a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth frombehind and my arms were pinioned the two brothers crossed the roadfrom a dark corner and identified me with a single gesture themarquis took from his pocket the letter i had written showed it meburnt it in the light of a lantern that was held and extinguished theashes with his foot not a word was spoken i was brought here iwas brought to my living grave  if it had pleased god to put it in the hard heart of either ofthe brothers in all these frightful years to grant me any tidings ofmy dearest wife so much as to let me know by a word whether aliveor dead i might have thought that he had not quite abandoned thembut now i believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to themand that they have no part in his mercies and them and theirdescendants to the last of their race i alexandre manetteunhappy prisoner do this last night of the year  in myunbearable agony denounce to the times when all these things shall beanswered for i denounce them to heaven and to earth  a terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done asound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it butblood the narrative called up the most revengeful passions of thetime and there was not a head in the nation but must have droppedbefore it  little need in presence of that tribunal and that auditory to showhow the defarges had not made the paper public with the othercaptured bastille memorials borne in procession and had kept itbiding their time little need to show that this detested familyname had long been anathematised by saint antoine and was wroughtinto the fatal register the man never trod ground whose virtues andservices would have sustained him in that place that day against suchdenunciation  and all the worse for the doomed man that the denouncer was awellknown citizen his own attached friend the father of his wifeone of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was for imitations ofthe questionable public virtues of antiquity and for sacrifices andselfimmolations on the peoples altar therefore when the presidentsaid else had his own head quivered on his shoulders that thegood physician of the republic would deserve better still of therepublic by rooting out an obnoxious family of aristocrats andwould doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter awidow and her child an orphan there was wild excitement patrioticfervour not a touch of human sympathy  much influence around him has that doctor murmured madamedefarge smiling to the vengeance save him now my doctor savehim  at every jurymans vote there was a roar another and another roarand roar  unanimously voted at heart and by descent an aristocrat an enemyof the republic a notorious oppressor of the people back to theconciergerie and death within fourandtwenty hours  xi  dusk  the wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die fell underthe sentence as if she had been mortally stricken but she utteredno sound and so strong was the voice within her representing that itwas she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and notaugment it that it quickly raised her even from that shock  the judges having to take part in a public demonstration out ofdoors the tribunal adjourned the quick noise and movement of thecourts emptying itself by many passages had not ceased when luciestood stretching out her arms towards her husband with nothing in herface but love and consolation  if i might touch him if i might embrace him once o goodcitizens if you would have so much compassion for us  there was but a gaoler left along with two of the four men whohad taken him last night and barsad the people had all poured out tothe show in the streets barsad proposed to the rest let her embracehim then it is but a moment it was silently acquiesced in and theypassed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place where heby leaning over the dock could fold her in his arms  farewell dear darling of my soul my parting blessing on mylove we shall meet again where the weary are at rest  they were her husbands words as he held her to his bosom  i can bear it dear charles i am supported from above dontsuffer for me a parting blessing for our child  i send it to her by you i kiss her by you i say farewell to herby you  my husband no a moment he was tearing himself apart from herwe shall not be separated long i feel that this will break myheart byandbye but i will do my duty while i can and when ileave her god will raise up friends for her as he did for me  her father had followed her and would have fallen on his knees toboth of them but that darnay put out a hand and seized him crying  no no what have you done what have you done that you shouldkneel to us we know now what a struggle you made of old we knownow what you underwent when you suspected my descent and when youknew it we know now the natural antipathy you strove against andconquered for her dear sake we thank you with all our hearts andall our love and duty heaven be with you  her fathers only answer was to draw his hands through his whitehair and wring them with a shriek of anguish  it could not be otherwise said the prisoner all things haveworked together as they have fallen out it was the alwaysvainendeavour to discharge my poor mothers trust that first brought myfatal presence near you good could never come of such evil a happierend was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning be comforted andforgive me heaven bless you  as he was drawn away his wife released him and stood looking afterhim with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer andwith a radiant look upon her face in which there was even acomforting smile as he went out at the prisoners door she turnedlaid her head lovingly on her fathers breast tried to speak tohim and fell at his feet  then issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never movedsydney carton came and took her up only her father and mr lorry werewith her his arm trembled as it raised her and supported her headyet there was an air about him that was not all of pity that had aflush of pride in it  shall i take her to a coach i shall never feel her weight  he carried her lightly to the door and laid her tenderly down ina coach her father and their old friend got into it and he tookhis seat beside the driver  when they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark notmany hours before to picture to himself on which of the roughstones of the street her feet had trodden he lifted her again andcarried her up rhe staircase to their rooms there he laid her downon a couch where her child and miss pross wept over her  dont recall her to herself he said softly to the lattershe is better so dont revive her to consciousness while she onlyfaints  oh carton carton carton cried little lucie springing up andthrowing her arms passionately round him in a burst of grief nowthat you have come i think you will do something to help mammasomething to save papa o look at her dear carton can you of allthe people who love her bear to see her so  he bent over the child and laid her blooming cheek against hisface he put her gently from him and looked at her unconsciousmother  before i go he said and paused i may kiss her  it was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touchedher face with his lips he murmured some words the child who wasnearest to him told them afterwards and told her grandchildrenwhen she was a handsome old lady that she heard him say a lifeyou love  when he had gone out into the next room he turned suddenly on mrlorry and her father who were following and said to the latter  you had great influence but yesterday doctor manette let it atleast be tried these judges and all the men in power are veryfriendly to you and very recognisant of your services are they not  nothing connected with charles was concealed from me i had thestrongest assurances that i should save him and i did he returnedthe answer in great trouble and very slowly  try them again the hours between this and tomorrow afternoonare few and short but try  i intend to try i will not rest a moment  thats well i have known such energy as yours do great thingsbefore now though never he added with a smile and a sigh togethersuch great things as this but try of little worth as life is whenwe misuse it it is worth that effort it would cost nothing to laydown if it were not  i will go said doctor manette to the prosecutor and thepresident straight and i will go to others whom it is better not toname i will write too and but stay there is a celebration in thestreets and no one will be accessible until dark  thats true well it is a forlorn hope at the best and not muchthe forlorner for being delayed till dark i should like to know howyou speed though mind i expect nothing when are you likely to haveseen these dread powers doctor manette  immediately after dark i should hope within an hour or two fromthis  it will be dark soon after four let us stretch the hour or two ifi go to mr lorrys at nine shall i hear what you have done eitherfrom our friend or from yourself  yes  may you prosper  mr lorry followed sydney to the outer door and touching him onthe shoulder as he was going away caused him to turn  i have no hope said mr lorry in a low and sorrowful whisper  nor have i  if any one of these men or all of these men were disposed tospare him which is a large supposition for what is his life orany mans to them i doubt if they durst spare him after thedemonstration in the court  and so do i i heard the fall of the axe in that sound  mr lorry leaned his arm upon the doorpost and bowed his face uponit  dont despond said carton very gently dont grieve iencouraged doctor manette in this idea because i felt that it mightone day be consolatory to her otherwise she might think his lifewas wantonly thrown away or wasted and that might trouble her  yes yes yes returned mr lorry drying his eyes you areright  but he will perish there is no real hope  yes he will perish there is no real hope echoed carton andwalked with a settled step downstairs  xii  darkness  sydney carton paused in the street not quite decided where to goat tellsons bankinghouse at nine he said with a musing faceshall i do well in the mean time to show myself i think so itis best that these people should know there is such a man as i hereit is a sound precaution and may be a necessary preparation butcare care let me think it out  checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object hetook a turn or two in the already darkening street and traced thethought in his mind to its possible consequences his first impressionwas confirmed it is best he said finally resolved that thesepeople should know there is such a man as i here and he turned hisface towards saint antoine  defarge had described himself that day as the keeper of awineshop in the saint antoine suburb it was not difficult for onewho knew the city well to find his house without asking any questionhaving ascertained its situation carton came out of those closerstreets again and dined at a place of refreshment and fell soundasleep after dinner for the first time in many years he had nostrong drink since last night he had taken nothing but a little lightthin wine and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on mrlorrys hearth like a man who had done with it  it was as late as seven oclock when he awoke refreshed and wentout into the streets again as he passed along towards saintantoine he stopped at a shopwindow where there was a mirror andslightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat andhis coatcollar and his wild hair this done he went on direct todefarges and went in  there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three ofthe restless fingers and the croaking voice this man whom he hadseen upon the jury stood drinking at the little counter inconversation with the defarges man and wife the vengeance assistedin the conversation like a regular member of the establishment  as carton walked in took his seat and asked in very indifferentfrench for a small measure of wine madame defarge cast a carelessglance at him and then a keener and then a keener and then advancedto him herself and asked him what it was he had ordered  he repeated what he had already said  english asked madame defarge inquisitively raising her darkeyebrows  after looking at her as if the sound of even a single french wordwere slow to express itself to him he answered in his formerstrong foreign accent yes madame yes i am english  madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine and as hetook up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out itsmeaning he heard her say i swear to you like evremonde  defarge brought him the wine and gave him good evening  how  good evening  oh good evening citizen filling his glass ah and goodwine i drink to the republic  defarge went back to the counter and said certainly a littlelike madame sternly retorted i tell you a good deal like jacquesthree pacifically remarked he is so much in your mind see youmadame the amiable vengeance added with a laugh yes my faithand you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him oncemore tomorrow  carton followed the lines and words of his paper with a slowforefinger and with a studious and absorbed face they were allleaning their arms on the counter close together speaking lowafter a silence of a few moments during which they all looked towardshim without disturbing his outward attention from the jacobineditor they resumed their conversation  it is true what madame says observed jacques three why stopthere is great force in that why stop  well well reasoned defarge but one must stop somewhereafter all the question is still where  at extermination said madame  magnificent croaked jacques three the vengeance also highlyapproved  extermination is good doctrine my wife said defarge rathertroubled in general i say nothing against it but this doctor hassuffered much you have seen him today you have observed his facewhen the paper was read  i have observed his face repeated madame contemptuously andangrily yes i have observed his face i have observed his face tobe not the face of a true friend of the republic let him take care ofhis face  and you have observed my wife said defarge in a deprecatorymanner the anguish of his daughter which must be a dreadful anguishto him  i have observed his daughter repeated madame yes i haveobserved his daughter more times than one i have observed hertoday and i have observed her other days i have observed her in thecourt and i have observed her in the street by the prison let me butlift my finger she seemed to raise it the listeners eyes werealways on his paper and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledgebefore her as if the axe had dropped  the citizeness is superb croaked the juryman  she is an angel said the vengeance and embraced her  as to thee pursued madame implacably addressing her husbandif it depended on thee which happily it does not thou wouldstrescue this man even now  no protested defarge not if to lift this glass would do it buti would leave the matter there i say stop there  see you then jacques said madame defarge wrathfully and seeyou too my little vengeance see you both listen for othercrimes as tyrants and oppressors i have this race a long time on myregister doomed to destruction and extermination ask my husbandis that so  it is so assented defarge without being asked  in the beginning of the great days when the bastille falls hefinds this paper of today and he brings it home and in the middleof the night when this place is clear and shut we read it here onthis spot by the light of this lamp ask him is that so  it is so assented defarge  that night i tell him when the paper is read through and thelamp is burnt out and the day is gleaming in above those shutters andbetween those iron bars that i have now a secret to communicateask him is that so  it is so assented defarge again  i communicate to him that secret i smite this bosom with these twohands as i smite it now and i tell him defarge i was brought upamong the fishermen of the seashore and that peasant family soinjured by the two evremonde brothers as that bastille paperdescribes is my family defarge that sister of the mortallywounded boy upon the ground was my sister that husband was mysisters husband that unborn child was their child that brotherwas my brother that father was my father those dead are my dead andthat summons to answer for those things descends to me ask him isthat so  it is so assented defarge once more  then tell wind and fire where to stop returned madame but donttell me  both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly natureof her wrath the listener could feel how white she was withoutseeing her and both highly commended it defarge a weak minorityinterposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of themarquis but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of herlast reply tell the wind and the fire where to stop not me  customers entered and the group was broken up the english customerpaid for what he had had perplexedly counted his change and askedas a stranger to be directed towards the national palace madamedefarge took him to the door and put her arm on his in pointingout the road the english customer was not without his reflectionsthen that it might be a good deed to seize that arm lift it andstrike under it sharp and deep  but he went his way and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of theprison wall at the appointed hour he emerged from it to presenthimself in mr lorrys room again where he found the old gentlemanwalking to and fro in restless anxiety he said he had been with lucieuntil just now and had only left her for a few minutes to come andkeep his appointment her father had not been seen since he quittedthe bankinghouse towards four oclock she had some faint hopesthat his mediation might save charles but they were very slight hehad been more than five hours gone where could he be  mr lorry waited until ten but doctor manette not returning andhe being unwilling to leave lucie any longer it was arranged thathe should go back to her and come to the bankinghouse again atmidnight in the meanwhile carton would wait alone by the fire forthe doctor  he waited and waited and the clock struck twelve but doctormanette did not come back mr lorry returned and found no tidings ofhim and brought none where could he be  they were discussing this question and were almost building up someweak structure of hope on his prolonged absence when they heard himon the stairs the instant he entered the room it was plain thatall was lost  whether he had really been to any one or whether he had been anthat time traversing the streets was never known as he stood staringat them they asked him no question for his face told themeverything  i cannot find it said he and i must have it where is it  his head and throat were bare and as he spoke with a helpless lookstraying all around he took his coat off and let it drop on thefloor  where is my bench i have been looking everywhere for my bench andi cant find it what have they done with my work time presses imust finish those shoes  they looked at one another and their hearts died within them  come come said he in a whimpering miserable way let me get towork give me my work  receiving no answer he tore his hair and beat his feet upon theground like a distracted child  dont torture a poor forlorn wretch he implored them with adreadful cry but give me my work what is to become of us ifthose shoes are not done tonight  lost utterly lost  it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him or try torestore him that as if by agreement they each put a hand uponhis shoulder and soothed him to sit down before the fire with apromise that he should have his work presently he sank into thechair and brooded over the embers and shed tears as if all that hadhappened since the garret time were a momentary fancy or a dream mrlorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that defarge had had inkeeping  affected and impressed with terror as they both were by thisspectacle of ruin it was not a time to yield to such emotions hislonely daughter bereft of her final hope and reliance appealed tothem both too strongly again as if by agreement they looked atone another with one meaning in their faces carton was the first tospeak  the last chance is gone it was not much yes he had better betaken to her but before you go will you for a moment steadilyattend to me dont ask me why i make the stipulations i am going tomake and exact the promise i am going to exact i have a reason agood one  i do not doubt it answered mr lorry say on  the figure in the chair between them was all the timemonotonously rocking itself to and fro and moaning they spoke insuch a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by asickbed in the night  carton stooped to pick up the coat which lay almost entanglinghis feet as he did so a small case in which the doctor wasaccustomed to carry the lists of his days duties fell lightly on thefloor carton took it up and there was a folded paper in it weshould look at this he said mr lorry nodded his consent he openedit and exclaimed thank god  what is it asked mr lorry o eagerly  a moment let me speak of it in its place first he put hishand in his coat and took another paper from it that is thecertificate which enables me to pass out of this city look at it yousee sydney carton an englishman  mr lorry held it open in his hand gazing in his earnest face  keep it for me until tomorrow i shall see him tomorrow youremember and i had better not take it into the prison  why not  i dont know i prefer not to do so now take this paper thatdoctor manette has carried about him it is a similar certificateenabling him and his daughter and her child at any time to passthe barrier and the frontier you see  yes  perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution againstevil yesterday when is it dated but no matter dont stay tolook put it up carefully with mine and your own now observe inever doubted until within this hour or two that he had or couldhave such a paper it is good until recalled but it may be soonrecalled and i have reason to think will be  they are not in danger  they are in great danger they are in danger of denunciation bymadame defarge i know it from her own lips i have overheard words ofthat womans tonight which have presented their danger to me instrong colours i have lost no time and since then i have seen thespy he confirms me he knows that a woodsawyer living by the prisonwall is under the control of the defarges and has been rehearsedby madame defarge as to his having seen her he never mentionedlucies name making signs and signals to prisoners it is easy toforesee that the pretence will be the common one a prison plot andthat it will involve her life and perhaps her childs and perhapsher fathers for both have been seen with her at that place dontlook so horrified you will save them all  heaven grant i may carton but how  i am going to tell you how it will depend on you and it coulddepend on no better man this new denunciation will certainly not takeplace until after tomorrow probably not until two or three daysafterwards more probably a week afterwards you know it is acapital crime to mourn for or sympathise with a victim of theguillotine she and her father would unquestionably be guilty ofthis crime and this woman the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannotbe described would wait to add that strength to her case and makeherself doubly sure you follow me  so attentively and with so much confidence in what you say thatfor the moment i lose sight touching the back of the doctors chaireven of this distress  you have money and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoastas quickly as the journey can be made your preparations have beencompleted for some days to return to england early tomorrow haveyour horses ready so that they may be in starting trim at two oclockin the afternoon  it shall be done  his manner was so fervent and inspiring that mr lorry caught theflame and was as quick as youth  you are a noble heart did i say we could depend upon no betterman tell her tonight what you know of her danger as involvingher child and her father dwell upon that for she would lay her ownfair head beside her husbands cheerfully he faltered for aninstant then went on as before for the sake of her child and herfather press upon her the necessity of leaving paris with them andyou at that hour tell her that it was her husbands lastarrangement tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believeor hope you think that her father even in this sad state willsubmit himself to her do you not  i am sure of it  i thought so quietly and steadily have all these arrangements madein the courtyard here even to the taking of your own seat in thecarriage the moment i come to you take me in and drive away  i understand that i wait for you under all circumstances  you have my certificate in your hand with the rest you know andwill reserve my place wait for nothing but to have my place occupiedand then for england  why then said mr lorry grasping his eager but so firm andsteady hand it does not all depend on one old man but i shallhave a young and ardent man at my side  by the help of heaven you shall promise me solemnly that nothingwill influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledgedto one another  nothing carton  remember these words tomorrow change the course or delay init for any reason and no life can possibly be saved and manylives must inevitably be sacrificed  i will remember them i hope to do my part faithfully  and i hope to do mine now good bye  though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness and though heeven put the old mans hand to his lips he did not part from himthen he helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before thedying embers as to get a cloak and hat put upon it and to tempt itforth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it stillmoaningly besought to have he walked on the other side of it andprotected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflictedheart so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his owndesolate heart to it outwatched the awful night he entered thecourtyard and remained there for a few moments alone looking up atthe light in the window of her room before he went away hebreathed a blessing towards it and a farewell  xiii  fiftytwo  in the black prison of the conciergerie the doomed of the dayawaited their fate they were in number as the weeks of the yearfiftytwo were to roll that afternoon on the lifetide of the cityto the boundless everlasting sea before their cells were quit ofthem new occupants were appointed before their blood ran into theblood spilled yesterday the blood that was to mingle with theirstomorrow was already set apart  two score and twelve were told off from the farmergeneral ofseventy whose riches could not buy his life to the seamstress oftwenty whose poverty and obscurity could not save her physicaldiseases engendered in the vices and neglects of men will seize onvictims of all degrees and the frightful moral disorder born ofunspeakable suffering intolerable oppression and heartlessindifference smote equally without distinction  charles darnay alone in a cell had sustained himself with noflattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal in everyline of the narrative he had heard he had heard his condemnationhe had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possiblysave him that he was virtually sentenced by the millions and thatunits could avail him nothing  nevertheless it was not easy with the face of his beloved wifefresh before him to compose his mind to what it must bear his holdon life was strong and it was very very hard to loosen bygradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here it clenched thetighter there and when he brought his strength to bear on that handand it yielded this was closed again there was a hurry too inall his thoughts a turbulent and heated working of his heart thatcontended against resignation if for a moment he did feel resignedthen his wife and child who had to live after him seemed to protestand to make it a selfish thing  but all this was at first before long the consideration thatthere was no disgrace in the fate he must meet and that numberswent the same road wrongfully and trod it firmly every day sprang upto stimulate him next followed the thought that much of the futurepeace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones depended on his quietfortitude so by degrees he calmed into the better state when hecould raise his thoughts much higher and draw comfort down  before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation he hadtravelled thus far on his last way being allowed to purchase themeans of writing and a light he sat down to write until such time asthe prison lamps should be extinguished  he wrote a long letter to lucie showing her that he had knownnothing of her fathers imprisonment until he had heard of it fromherself and that he had been as ignorant as she of his fathers anduncles responsibility for that misery until the paper had been readhe had already explained to her that his concealment from herself ofthe name he had relinquished was the one condition fullyintelligible now that her father had attached to their betrothal andwas the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of theirmarriage he entreated her for her fathers sake never to seek toknow whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of thepaper or had had it recalled to him for the moment or for good bythe story of the tower on that old sunday under the dear oldplanetree in the garden if he had preserved any definite remembranceof it there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyedwith the bastille when he had found no mention of it among the relicsof prisoners which the populace had discovered there and which hadbeen described to all the world he besought her though he added thathe knew it was needless to console her father by impressing himthrough every tender means she could think of with the truth thathe had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself buthad uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes next to herpreservation of his own last grateful love and blessing and herovercoming of her sorrow to devote herself to their dear child headjured her as they would meet in heaven to comfort her father  to her father himself he wrote in the same strain but he told herfather that he expressly confided his wife and child to his careand he told him this very strongly with the hope of rousing him fromany despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw hemight be tending  to mr lorry he commended them all and explained his worldlyaffairs that done with many added sentences of grateful friendshipand warm attachment all was done he never thought of carton hismind was so full of the others that he never once thought of him  he had time to finish these letters before the lights were putout when he lay down on his straw bed he thought he had done withthis world  but it beckoned him back in his sleep and showed itself in shiningforms free and happy back in the old house in soho though it hadnothing in it like the real house unaccountably released and lightof heart he was with lucie again and she told him it was all adream and he had never gone away a pause of forgetfulness andthen he had even suffered and had come back to her dead and atpeace and yet there was no difference in him another pause ofoblivion and he awoke in the sombre morning unconscious where he wasor what had happened until it flashed upon his mind this is the dayof my death  thus had he come through the hours to the day when the fiftytwoheads were to fall and now while he was composed and hoped thatbe could meet the end with quiet heroism a new action began in hiswaking thoughts which was very difficult to master  he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life howhigh it was from the ground how many steps it had where he wouldbe stood how he would be touched whether the touching hands would bedyed red which way his face would be turned whether he would bethe first or might be the last these and many similar questionsin nowise directed by his will obtruded themselves over and overagain countless times neither were they connected with fear hewas conscious of no fear rather they originated in a strangebesetting desire to know what to do when the time came a desiregigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which itreferred a wondering that was more like the wondering of some otherspirit within his than his own  the hours went on as he walked to and fro and the clocks struck thenumbers he would never hear again nine gone for ever ten gone forever eleven gone for ever twelve coming on to pass away after ahard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had lastperplexed him he had got the better of it he walked up and downsoftly repeating their names to himself the worst of the strife wasover he could walk up and down free from distracting fanciespraying for himself and for them  twelve gone for ever  he had been apprised that the final hour was three and he knew hewould be summoned some time earlier inasmuch as the tumbrils joltedheavily and slowly through the streets therefore he resolved to keeptwo before his mind as the hour and so to strengthen himself inthe interval that he might be able after that time to strengthenothers  walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast avery different man from the prisoner who had walked to and fro atla force he heard one struck away from him without surprise thehour had measured like most other hours devoutly thankful to heavenfor his recovered selfpossession he thought there is but anothernow and turned to walk again  footsteps in the stone passage outside the door he stopped  the key was put in the lock and turned before the door was openedor as it opened a man said in a low voice in english he hasnever seen me here i have kept out of his way go you in alone iwait near lose no time  the door was quickly opened and closed and there stood before himface to face quiet intent upon him with the light of a smile on hisfeatures and a cautionary finger on his lip sydney carton  there was something so bright and remarkable in his look thatfor the first moment the prisoner misdoubted him to be anapparition of his own imagining but he spoke and it was hisvoice he took the prisoners hand and it was his real grasp  of all the people upon earth you least expected to see me hesaid  i could not believe it to be you i can scarcely believe it nowyou are not the apprehension came suddenly into his mind aprisoner  no i am accidentally possessed of a power over one of thekeepers here and in virtue of it i stand before you i come from heryour wife dear darnay  the prisoner wrung his hand  i bring you a request from her  what is it  a most earnest pressing and emphatic entreaty addressed to youin the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you that youwell remember  the prisoner turned his face partly aside  you have no time to ask me why i bring it or what it means i haveno time to tell you you must comply with it take off those boots youwear and draw on these of mine  there was a chair against the wall of the cell behind the prisonercarton pressing forward had already with the speed of lightninggot him down into it and stood over him barefoot  draw on these boots of mine put your hands to them put yourwill to them quick  carton there is no escaping from this place it never can be doneyou will only die with me it

minewhile you do it let me take this ribbon from your hair and shake outyour hair like this of mine  with wonderful quickness and with a strength both of will andaction that appeared quite supernatural he forced all thesechanges upon him the prisoner was like a young child in his hands  carton dear carton it is madness it cannot be accomplished itnever can be done it has been attempted and has always failed iimplore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine  do i ask you my dear darnay to pass the door when i ask thatrefuse there are pen and ink and paper on this table is your handsteady enough to write  it was when you came in  steady it again and write what i shall dictate quick friendquick  pressing his hand to his bewildered head darnay sat down at thetable carton with his right hand in his breast stood close besidehim  write exactly as i speak  to whom do i address it  to no one carton still had his hand in his breast  do i date it  no  the prisoner looked up at each question carton standing overhim with his hand in his breast looked down  if you remember said carton dictating the words that passedbetween us long ago you will readily comprehend this when you seeit you do remember them i know it is not in your nature to forgetthem  he was drawing his hand from his breast the prisoner chancing tolook up in his hurried wonder as he wrote the hand stopped closingupon something  have you written forget them carton asked  i have is that a weapon in your hand  no i am not armed  what is it in your hand  you shall know directly write on there are but a few words morehe dictated again i am thankful that the time has come when ican prove them that i do so is no subject for regret or grief ashe said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer his hand slowlyand softly moved down close to the writers face  the pen dropped from darnays fingers on the table and he lookedabout him vacantly  what vapour is that he asked  vapour  something that crossed me  i am conscious of nothing there can be nothing here take up thepen and finish hurry hurry  as if his memory were impaired or his faculties disordered theprisoner made an effort to rally his attention as he looked at cartonwith clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing carton hishand again in his breast looked steadily at him  hurry hurry  the prisoner bent over the paper once more  if it had been otherwise cartons hand was again watchfully andsoftly stealing down i never should have used the longeropportunity if it had been otherwise the hand was at theprisoners face i should but have had so much the more to answerfor if it had been otherwise carton looked at the pen and saw itwas trailing off into unintelligible signs  cartons hand moved back to his breast no more the prisonersprang up with a reproachful look but cartons hand was close andfirm at his nostrils and cartons left arm caught him round thewaist for a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who hadcome to lay down his life for him but within a minute or so hewas stretched insensible on the ground  quickly but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart wascarton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid asidecombed back his hair and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner hadworn then he softly called enter there come in and the spypresented himself  you see said carton looking up as he kneeled on one knee besidethe insensible figure putting the paper in the breast is yourhazard very great  mr carton the spy answered with a timid snap of his fingersmy hazard is not

by you in that dress i shall have no fear  have no fear i shall soon be out of the way of harming you andthe rest will soon be far from here please god now get assistanceand take me to the coach  you said the spy nervously  him man with whom i have exchanged you go out at the gate bywhich you brought me in  of course  i was weak and faint when you brought me in and i am fainter nowyou take me out the parting interview has overpowered me such athing has happened here often and too often your life is in yourown hands quick call assistance  you swear not to betray me said the trembling spy as he pausedfor a last moment  man man returned carton stamping his foot have i sworn byno solemn vow already to go through with this that you waste theprecious moments now take him yourself to the

night anddrive away  the spy withdrew and carton seated himself at the table restinghis forehead on his hands the spy returned immediately with two men  how then said one of them contemplating the fallen figureso afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lotteryof sainte guillotine  a good patriot said the other could hardly have been moreafflicted if the aristocrat had drawn a blank  they raised the unconscious figure placed it on a litter they hadbrought to the door and bent to carry it away  the time is short evremonde said the spy in a warning voice  i know it well answered carton be careful of my friend ientreat you and leave me  come then my children said barsad lift him and come away  the door closed and carton was left alone straining his powersof listening to the utmost he listened for any sound that mightdenote suspicion or alarm there was none keys turned doors clashedfootsteps passed along distant passages no cry was raised or hurrymade that seemed unusual breathing more freely in a little while hesat down at the table and listened again until the clock struck two  sounds that he was not afraid of for he divined their meaning thenbegan to be audible several doors were opened in succession andfinally his own a gaoler with a list in his hand looked inmerely saying follow me evremonde and he followed into a largedark room at a distance it was a dark winter day and what withthe shadows within and what with the shadows without he could butdimly discern the others who were brought there to have their armsbound some were standing some seated some were lamenting and inrestless motion but these were few the great majority were silentand still looking fixedly at the ground  as he stood by the wall in a dim corner while some of the fiftytwowere brought in after him one man stopped in passing to embrace himas having a knowledge of him it thrilled him with a great dread ofdiscovery but the man went on a very few moments after that a youngwoman with a slight girlish form a sweet spare face in which therewas no vestige of colour and large widely opened patient eyes rosefrom the seat where he had observed her sitting and came to speakto him  citizen evremonde she said touching him with her cold hand iam a poor little seamstress who was with you in la force  he murmured for answer true i forget what you were accused of  plots though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any isit likely who would think of plotting with a poor little weakcreature like me  the forlorn smile with which she said it so touched him that tearsstarted from his eyes  i am not afraid to die citizen evremonde but i have done nothingi am not unwilling to die if the republic which is to do so much goodto us poor will profit by my death but i do not know how that canbe citizen evremonde such a poor weak little creature  as the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften toit warmed and softened to this pitiable girl  i heard you were released citizen evremonde i hoped it was true  it was but i was again taken and condemned  if i may ride with you citizen evremonde will you let me holdyour hand i am not afraid but i am little and weak and it will giveme more courage  as the patient eyes were lifted to his face he saw a sudden doubtin them and then astonishment he pressed the workwornhungerworn young fingers and touched his lips  are you dying for him she whispered  and his wife and child hush yes  o you will let me hold your brave hand stranger  hush yes my poor sister to the last  the same shadows that are falling on the prison are falling inthat same hour of the early afternoon on the barrier with the crowdabout it when a coach going out of paris drives up to be examined  who goes here whom have we

being the last  it is jarvis lorry who has replied to all the previous questions itis jarvis lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coachdoor replying to a group of officials they leisurely walk roundthe carriage and leisurely mount the box to look at what littleluggage it carries on the roof the countrypeople hanging aboutpress nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in a little childcarried by its mother has its short arm held out for it that itmay touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the guillotine  behold your papers jarvis lorry countersigned  one can

there is terror in the carriage there is weepingthere is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller  are we not going too slowly can they not be induced to go fasterasks lucie clinging to the old

houses in twos and threes pass by us solitary farms ruinousbuildings dyeworks tanneries and the like open country avenuesof leafless trees the hard uneven pavement is under us the soft deepmud is on either side sometimes we strike into the skirting mudto avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us sometimes westick in ruts and sloughs there the agony of our impatience is thenso great that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting outand running hiding doing anything but stopping  out of the open country in again among ruinous buildingssolitary farms dyeworks tanneries and the like cottages in twosand threes avenues of leafless trees have these men deceived us andtaken us back by another road is not this the same place twiceover thank heaven no a village look back look back and

and the whole wild night is inpursuit of us but so far we are pursued by nothing else  xiv  the knitting done  in that same juncture of time when the fiftytwo awaited theirfate madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance andjacques three of the revolutionary jury not in the wineshop didmadame defarge confer with these ministers but in the shed of thewoodsawyer erst a mender of roads the sawyer himself did notparticipate in the conference but abided at a little distance likean outer satellite who was not to speak until required or to offer anopinion until invited  but our defarge said jacques three is undoubtedly a goodrepublican eh  there is no better the voluble vengeance protested in hershrill notes in france  peace little vengeance said madame defarge laying her hand witha slight frown on her lieutenants lips hear me speak my husbandfellowcitizen is a good republican and a bold man he has deservedwell of the republic and possesses its confidence but my husband hashis weaknesses and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor  it is a great pity croaked jacques three dubiously shaking hishead with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth it is not quitelike a good citizen it is a thing to regret  see you said madame i care nothing for this doctor i he maywear his head or lose it for any interest i have in him it is allone to me but the evremonde people are to be exterminated and thewife and child must follow the husband and father  she has a fine head for it croaked jacques three i have seenblue eyes and golden hair there and they looked charming whensamson held them up ogre that he was he spoke like an epicure  madame defarge cast down her eyes and reflected a little  the child also observed jacques three with a meditativeenjoyment of his words has golden hair and blue eyes and weseldom have a child there it is a pretty sight  in a word said madame defarge coming out of her shortabstraction i cannot trust my husband in this matter not only doi feel since last night that i dare not confide to him the detailsof my projects but also i feel that if i delay there is danger ofhis giving warning and then they might escape  that must never be croaked jacques three no one must escape wehave not half enough as it is we ought to have six score a day  in a word madame defarge went on my husband has not my reasonfor pursuing this family to annihilation and i have not his reasonfor regarding this doctor with any sensibility i must act for myselftherefore come hither little citizen  the woodsawyer who held her in the respect and himself in thesubmission of mortal fear advanced with his hand to his red cap  touching those signals little citizen said madame defargesternly that she made to the prisoners you are ready to bearwitness to them this very day  ay ay why not cried the sawyer every day in all weathersfrom two to four always signalling sometimes with the little onesometimes without i know what i know i have seen with my eyes  he made all manner of gestures while he spoke as if in incidentalimitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he hadnever seen  clearly plots said jacques three transparently  there is no doubt of the jury inquired madame defarge lettingher eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile  rely upon the patriotic jury dear citizeness i answer for myfellow jurymen  now let me see said madame defarge pondering again yet oncemore can i spare this doctor to my husband i have no feelingeither way can i spare him  he would count as one head observed jacques three in a lowvoice we really have not heads enough it would be a pity i think  he was signalling with her when i saw her argued madamedefarge i cannot speak of one without the other and i must not besilent and trust the case wholly to him this little citizen herefor i am not a bad witness  the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in theirfervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellousof witnesses the little citizen not to be outdone declared her tobe a celestial witness  he must take his chance said madame defarge no i cannotspare him you are engaged at three oclock you are going to seethe batch of today executed you  the question was addressed to the woodsawyer who hurriedly repliedin the affirmative seizing the occasion to add that he was the mostardent of republicans and that he would be in effect the mostdesolate of republicans if anything prevented him from enjoying thepleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of thedroll national barber he was so very demonstrative herein that hemight have been suspected perhaps was by the dark eyes that lookedcontemptuously at him out of madame defarges head of having hissmall individual fears for his own personal safety every hour inthe day  i said madame am equally engaged at the same place after it isover say at eight tonight come you to me in saint antoine andwe will give information against these people at my section  the woodsawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend thecitizeness the citizeness looking at him he became embarrassedevaded her glance as a small dog would have done retreated amonghis wood and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw  madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a littlenearer to the door and there expounded her further views to themthus  she will now be at home awaiting the moment of his death she willbe mourning and grieving she will be in a state of mind to impeachthe justice of the republic she will be full of sympathy with itsenemies i will go to her  what an admirable woman what an adorable woman exclaimed jacquesthree rapturously ah my cherished cried the vengeance andembraced her  take you my knitting said madame defarge placing it in herlieutenants hands and have it ready for me in my usual seat keepme my usual chair go you there straight for there will probablybe a greater concourse than usual today  i willingly obey the orders of my chief said the vengeance withalacrity and kissing her cheek you will not be late  i shall be there before the commencement  and before the tumbrils arrive be sure you are there my soulsaid the vengeance calling after her for she had already turned intothe street before the tumbrils arrive  madame defarge slightly waved her hand to imply that she heard andmight be relied upon to arrive in good time and so went through themud and round the corner of the prison wall the vengeance and thejuryman looking after her as she walked away were highlyappreciative of her fine figure and her superb moral endowments  there were many women at that time upon whom the time laid adreadfully disfiguring hand but there was not one among them more tobe dreaded than this ruthless woman now taking her way along thestreets of a strong and fearless character of shrewd sense andreadiness of great determination of that kind of beauty which notonly seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity but tostrike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualitiesthe troubled time would have heaved her up under any circumstancesbut imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong andan inveterate hatred of a class opportunity had developed her intoa tigress she was absolutely without pity if she had ever had thevirtue in her it had quite gone out of her  it was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for thesins of his forefathers she saw not him but them it was nothing toher that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter anorphan that was insufficient punishment because they were hernatural enemies and her prey and as such had no right to live toappeal to her was made hopeless by her having no sense of pityeven for herself if she had been laid low in the streets in any ofthe many encounters in which she had been engaged she would nothave pitied herself nor if she had been ordered to the axetomorrow would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than afierce desire to change places with the man who sent here there  such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe carelesslyworn it was a becoming robe enough in a certain weird way and herdark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap lying hidden in herbosom was a loaded pistol lying hidden at her waist was a sharpeneddagger thus accoutred and walking with the confident tread of such acharacter and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habituallywalked in her girlhood barefoot and barelegged on the brownseasand madame defarge took her way along the streets  now when the journey of the travelling coach at that very momentwaiting for the completion of its load had been planned out lastnight the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engagedmr lorrys attention it was not merely desirable to avoidoverloading the coach but it was of the highest importance that thetime occupied in examining it and its passengers should be reduced tothe utmost since their escape might depend on the saving of only afew seconds here and there finally he had proposed after anxiousconsideration that miss pross and jerry who were at liberty to leavethe city should leave it at three oclock in the lightestwheeledconveyance known to that period unencumbered with luggage they wouldsoon overtake the coach and passing it and preceding it on the roadwould order its horses in advance and greatly facilitate its progressduring the precious hours of the night when delay was the most tobe dreaded  seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service inthat pressing emergency miss pross hailed it with joy she andjerry had beheld the coach start had known who it was that solomonbrought had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense and werenow concluding their arrangements to follow the coach even asmadame defarge taking her way through the streets now drew nearerand nearer to the elsedeserted lodging in which they held theirconsultation  now what do you think mr cruncher said miss pross whoseagitation was so great that she could hardly speak or stand or moveor live what do you think of our not starting from this courtyardanother carriage having already gone from here today it might awakensuspicion  my opinion miss returned mr cruncher is as youre rightlikewise wot ill stand by you right or wrong  i am so distracted with fear and hope for our preciouscreatures said miss pross wildly crying that i am incapable offorming any plan are you capable of forming any plan my dear goodmr cruncher  respectin a future spear o life miss returned mr cruncher ihope so respectin any present use o this here blessed old head omind i think not would you do me the favour miss to take notice otwo promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this herecrisis  oh for gracious sake cried miss pross still wildly cryingrecord them at once and get them out of the way like an excellentman  first said mr cruncher who was all in a tremble and whospoke with an ashy and solemn visage them poor things well out othis never no more will i do it never no more  i am quite sure mr cruncher returned miss pross that younever will do it again whatever it is and i be you not to thinkit necessary to mention more particularly what it is  no miss returned jerry it shall not be named to you secondthem poor things well out o this and never no more will iinterfere with mrs crunchers flopping never no more  whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be said miss prossstriving to dry her eyes and compose herself i have no doubt it isbest that mrs cruncher should have it entirely under her ownsuperintendence o my poor darlings  i go so far as to say miss moreover proceeded mr cruncherwith a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit and letmy words be took down and took to mrs cruncher through yourself thatwot my opinions respectin flopping has undergone a change and thatwot i only hope with all my heart as mrs cruncher may be a floppingat the present time  there there there i hope she is my dear man cried thedistracted miss pross and i hope she finds it answering herexpectations  forbid it proceeded mr cruncher with additional solemnityadditional slowness and additional tendency to hold forth and holdout as anything wot i have ever said or done should be visited on myearnest wishes for them poor creeturs now forbid it as we shouldntall flop if it was anyways conwenient to get em out o this heredismal risk forbid it miss wot i say forbid it this was mrcrunchers conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to finda better one  and still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets camenearer and nearer  if we ever get back to our native land said miss pross youmay rely upon my telling mrs cruncher as much as i may be able toremember and understand of what you have so impressively said andat all events you may be sure that i shall bear witness to yourbeing thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time now pray let usthink my esteemed mr cruncher let us think  still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets camenearer and nearer  if you were to go before said miss pross and stop the vehicleand horses from coming here and were to wait somewhere for mewouldnt that be best  mr cruncher thought it might be best  where could you wait for me asked miss pross  mr cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no localitybut temple bar alas temple bar was hundreds of miles away andmadame defarge was drawing very near indeed  by the cathedral door said miss pross would it be much out ofthe way to take me in near the great cathedral door between thetwo towers  no miss answered mr cruncher  then like the best of men said miss pross go to thepostinghouse straight and make that change  i am doubtful said mr cruncher hesitating and shaking his headabout leaving of you you see we dont know what may happen  heaven knows we dont returned miss pross but have no fearfor me take me in at the cathedral at three oclock or as near itas you can and i am sure it will be better than our going fromhere i feel certain of it there bless you mr cruncher think notof me but of the lives that may depend on both of us  this exordium and miss prosss two hands in quite agonised entreatyclasping his decided mr cruncher with an encouraging nod or two heimmediately went out to alter the arrangements and left her byherself to follow as she had proposed  the having originated a precaution which was already in course ofexecution was a great relief to miss pross the necessity ofcomposing her appearance so that it should attract no special noticein the streets was another relief she looked at her watch and itwas twenty minutes past two she had no time to lose but must getready at once  afraid in her extreme perturbation of the loneliness of thedeserted rooms and of halfimagined faces peeping from behind everyopen door in them miss pross got a basin of cold water and beganlaving her eyes which were swollen and red haunted by her feverishapprehensions she could not bear to have her sight obscured for aminute at a time by the dripping water but constantly paused andlooked round to see that there was no one watching her in one ofthose pauses she recoiled and cried out for she saw a figure standingin the room  the basin fell to the ground broken and the water flowed to thefeet of madame defarge by strange stern ways and through muchstaining blood those feet had come to meet that water  madame defarge looked coldly at her and said the wife ofevremonde where is she  it flashed upon miss prosss mind that the doors were all standingopen and would suggest the flight her first act was to shut themthere were four in the room and she shut them all she then placedherself before the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied  madame defarges dark eyes followed her through this rapid movementand rested on her when it was finished miss pross had nothingbeautiful about her years had not tamed the wildness or softened thegrimness of her appearance but she too was a determined woman inher different way and she measured madame defarge with her eyesevery inch  you might from your appearance be the wife of lucifer said misspross in her breathing nevertheless you shall not get the betterof me i am an englishwoman  madame defarge looked at her scornfully but still with something ofmiss prosss own perception that they two were at bay she saw atight hard wiry woman before her as mr lorry had seen in thesame figure a woman with a strong hand in the years gone by she knewfull well that miss pross was the familys devoted friend misspross knew full well that madame defarge was the familys malevolentenemy  on my way yonder said madame defarge with a slight movement ofher hand towards the fatal spot where they reserve my chair and myknitting for me i am come to make my compliments to her in passing iwish to see her  i know that your intentions are evil said miss pross and youmay depend upon it ill hold my own against them  each spoke in her own language neither understood the otherswords both were very watchful and intent to deduce from look andmanner what the unintelligible words meant  it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at thismoment said madame defarge good patriots will know what thatmeans let me see her go tell her that i wish to see her do youhear  if those eyes of yours were bedwinches returned miss pross andi was an english fourposter they shouldnt loose a splinter of meno you wicked foreign woman i am your match  madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks indetail but she so far understood them as to perceive that she wasset at naught  woman imbecile and piglike said madame defarge frowning itake no answer from you i demand to see her either tell her that idemand to see her or stand out of the way of the door and let me goto her this with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm  i little thought said miss pross that i should ever want tounderstand your nonsensical language but i would give all i haveexcept the clothes i wear to know whether you suspect the truth orany part of it  neither of them for a single moment released the others eyesmadame defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when misspross first became aware of her but she now advanced one step  i am a briton said miss pross i am desperate i dont care anenglish twopence for myself i know that the longer i keep you herethe greater hope there is for my ladybird ill not leave a handful ofthat dark hair upon your head if you lay a finger on me  thus miss pross with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyesbetween every rapid sentence and every rapid sentence a whole breaththus miss pross who had never struck a blow in her life  but her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought theirrepressible tears into her eyes this was a courage that madamedefarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness ha hashe laughed you poor wretch what are you worth i address myself tothat doctor then she raised her voice and called out citizendoctor wife of evremonde child of evremonde any person but thismiserable fool answer the citizeness defarge  perhaps the following silence perhaps some latent disclosure in theexpression of miss prosss face perhaps a sudden misgiving apart fromeither suggestion whispered to madame defarge that they were gonethree of the doors she opened swiftly and looked in  those rooms are all in disorder there has been hurried packingthere are odds and ends upon the ground there is no one in thatroom behind you let me look  never said miss pross who understood the request as perfectly asmadame defarge understood the answer  if they are not in that room they are gone and can be pursued andbrought back said madame defarge to herself  as long as you dont know whether they are in that room or not youare uncertain what to do said miss pross to herself and youshall not know that if i can prevent your knowing it and knowthat or not know that you shall not leave here while i can holdyou  i have been in the streets from the first nothing has stoppedme i will tear you to pieces but i will have you from that doorsaid madame defarge  we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard weare not likely to be heard and i pray for bodily strength to keep youhere while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousandguineas to my darling said miss pross  madame defarge made at the door miss pross on the instinct ofthe moment seized her round the waist in both her arms and heldher tight it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and tostrike miss pross with the vigorous tenacity of love always so muchstronger than hate clasped her tight and even lifted her from thefloor in the struggle that they had the two hands of madame defargebuffeted and tore her face but miss pross with her head downheld her round the waist and clung to her with more than the holdof a drowning woman  soon madame defarges hands ceased to strike and felt at herencircled waist it is under my arm said miss pross in smotheredtones you shall not draw it i am stronger than you i blessheaven for it i hold you till one or other of us faints or dies  madame defarges hands were at her bosom miss pross looked upsaw what it was struck at it struck out a flash and a crash andstood alone blinded with smoke  all this was in a second as the smoke cleared leaving an awfulstillness it passed out on the air like the soul of the furiouswoman whose body lay lifeless on the ground  in the first fright and horror of her situation miss pross passedthe body as far from it as she could and ran down the stairs tocall for fruitless help happily she bethought herself of theconsequences of what she did in time to check herself and go back itwas dreadful to go in at the door again but she did go in andeven went near it to get the bonnet and other things that she mustwear these she put on out on the staircase first shutting andlocking the door and taking away the key she then sat down on thestairs a few moments to breathe and to cry and then got up andhurried away  by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet or she could hardlyhave gone along the streets without being stopped by good fortunetoo she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to showdisfigurement like any other woman she needed both advantages forthe marks of griping fingers were deep in her face and her hair wastorn and her dress hastily composed with unsteady hands wasclutched and dragged a hundred ways  in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the riverarriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort andwaiting there she thought what if the key were already taken in anet what if it were identified what if the door were opened andthe remains discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sentto prison and charged with murder in the midst of these flutteringthoughts the escort appeared took her in and took her away  is there any noise in the streets she asked him  the usual noises mr cruncher replied and looked surprised bythe question and by her aspect  i dont hear you said miss pross what do you say  it was in vain for mr cruncher to repeat what he said miss prosscould not hear him so ill nod my head thought mr cruncheramazed at all events shell see that and she did  is there any noise in the streets now asked miss pross againpresently  again mr cruncher nodded his head  i dont hear it  gone deaf in an hour said mr cruncher ruminating with his mindmuch disturbed wots come to her  i feel said miss pross as if there had been a flash and acrash and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in thislife  blest if she aint in a queer condition said mr cruncher moreand more disturbed wot can she have been a takin to keep hercourage up hark theres the roll of them dreadful carts you canhear that miss  i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to hernothing o my good man there was first a great crash and then agreat stillness and that stillness seems to be fixed andunchangeable never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts  if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful carts now very nightheir journeys end said mr cruncher glancing over his shoulderits my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in thisworld  and indeed she never did  xv  the footsteps die out for ever  along the paris streets the deathcarts rumble hollow and harshsix tumbrils carry the days wine to la guillotine all thedevouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination couldrecord itself are fused in the one realisation guillotine and yetthere is not in france with its rich variety of soil and climate ablade a leaf a root a sprig a peppercorn which will grow tomaturity under conditions more certain than those that have producedthis horror crush humanity out of shape once more under similarhammers and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms sowthe same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again and itwill surely yield the same fruit according to its kind  six tumbrils roll along the streets change these back again to whatthey were thou powerful enchanter time and they shall be seen to bethe carriages of absolute monarchs the equipages of feudal noblesthe toilettes of flaring jezebels the churches that are not myfathers house but dens of thieves the huts of millions of starvingpeasants no the great magician who majestically works out theappointed order of the creator never reverses his transformationsif thou be changed into this shape by the will of god say the seersto the enchanted in the wise arabian stories then remain so butif thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration then resumethy former aspect changeless and hopeless the tumbrils roll along  as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem toplough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streetsridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughsgo steadily onward so used are the regular inhabitants of thehouses to the spectacle that in many windows there are no people andin some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspendedwhile the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils here and therethe inmate has visitors to see the sight then he points his fingerwith something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponentto this cart and to this and seems to tell who sat here yesterdayand who there the day before  of the riders in the tumbrils some observe these things and allthings on their last roadside with an impassive stare others with alingering interest in the ways of life and men some seated withdrooping heads are sunk in silent despair again there are some soheedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude suchglances as they have seen in theatres and in pictures severalclose their eyes and think or try to get their straying thoughtstogether only one and he a miserable creature of a crazed aspectis so shattered and made drunk by horror that he sings and triesto dance not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture tothe pity of the people  there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrilsand faces are often turned up to some of them and they are asked somequestion it would seem to be always the same question for it isalways followed by a press of people towards the third cart thehorsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it withtheir swords the leading curiosity is to know which is he he standsat the back of the tumbril with his head bent down to converse witha mere girl who sits on the side of the cart and holds his hand hehas no curiosity or care for the scene about him and always speaks toto the girl here and there in the long street of st honore criesare raised against him if they move him at all it is only to aquiet smile as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about hisface he cannot easily touch his face his arms being bound  on the steps of a church awaiting the comingup of the tumbrilsstands the spy and prisonsheep he looks into the first of
